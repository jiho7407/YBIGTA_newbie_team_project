5.0,2019-10-18,"its not really a review but my attempt to explain how i interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated especially if the reason is that they didnt like the second half of it

its much easier to understand the message of a movie when the good guys win or the bad guys get punished in the end im not saying that all hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values but still i believe that parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which theres a character with a clearer moral center whom audiences can easily relate to so i think its no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences

some complained that they dont understand kitaeks motive for killing mr park but to fully appreciate this you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is crossing the line

its a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other peoples privacy or as one should mind ones own social position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position if interpreted as the latter meaning it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families respective dwellings

it would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner but the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if bong joonho chose such a path and he is too good a director not to see such a danger

instead he chose to make mr park a reasonable enough character despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature",11400.0,"[ 0.04053201  0.05062184  0.00044575  0.00330104 -0.00830338  0.01060164

5.0,2019-07-05,"i am remarkably stingy with my 1010 ratings ill be the first person to acknowledge this of the roughly 2600 titles ive rated on here only 34 have a 10 parasite is one of them if this isnt a masterpiece then i dont know what is

im going to keep it vague on the plotfront because i didnt know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways

what i will say is that this film more than just about any other ive seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent parts of this movie were hilarious parts were heartbreaking other parts were insanely suspenseful im honestly not sure if ive felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of breaking bad way back in 2013

and it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast all the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering you come to care for just about all of them

im stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie and sure ive seen many movies that are hard to fault but its rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect its extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake theres a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movies over and this ones not going to leave my head for a while i can tell

catch this one when you can and believe the hype joonho bong has made many great films and so far no bad ones but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others",11656.25,"[ 4.0902700e-02  4.9013827e-02 -9.5496261e-03  2.4508529e-03

4.0,2019-10-06,"i cant remember the last time i saw a movie that contained as many genres as parasite the movie starts out almost like an oceans eleven heist film and then expands into a comedy mystery thriller drama romance crime and even horror film it really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too

i love a film that respects its audience there are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats there are a lot of layers to this film and i suspect for this reason its rewatchability factor will be very high

the film was incredibly entertaining too i cant think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening at least in terms of action fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this i had a great time with parasite and i think most that give it a chance will too",2243.25,"[ 4.3947604e-02  5.7459891e-02 -9.8668421e-03  5.2104127e-03

5.0,2019-08-25,"in a meritocracy success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve itthose who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination anyone can rise to the top and for some lucky cinderella plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society i started with nothing and ended up with everything i ever desired you too can achieve you dreams if only you try

the promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition backstabbing deceit and callousness you climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one and then perhaps when you at last feel secure you can afford to be kind and confident and generous its easy to be nice when youre rich the mother in this film jang hyejin at one point observes

but its a very long and very crooked ladder and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip and sometimes theyve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked downeither by those above you or just as often by those staring up from the ground below there are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder

but in a meritocracy you cant blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it no you must blame yourself you should have tread more carefully you should have climbed more quickly you should have used a firmer and more precise grip anticipated disasters and known just when to leap if you fail in a meritocracy its all your fault you should have tried harder better luck next time",11287.5,"[ 3.75613905e-02  4.46619317e-02 -6.44621439e-04  1.75905030e-03

thats not to say that us is an ineffective film by any means but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare writerdirector bong joonho is in a class of his own

the film follows a lowerclass south korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upperclass family and their lavish household as their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances

its a twisty satire on socialeconomic disparities in south korean society that swings broadly in tone and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts

however to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride",5092.0,"[ 3.8917661e-02  4.9524128e-02  5.0017843e-03  1.7011166e-02

3.5,2020-04-12,"it was entertaining with good execution but best picture

some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer

others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for  while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical american narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status to its credit i think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewers emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively nonvirtuous and indeed villainous what seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane this incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect

now many are praising the supposedly deep revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle but i dont find it nearly as profound as is claimed the overtly sensational absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message and the storyline even leaving aside the overthetop scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction more importantly the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a onesided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of classdeterminant normalcy it strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue even in momentary antithesis yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one and also an implausible one because the world is not so onesided and simple for this reason the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics",1928.0,"[ 0.0373845   0.04826003 -0.00388018  0.01377769 -0.00685596  0.00802557

4.5,2020-01-16,"this is a movie about a class struggle in south korea like what movie us attempts to do but done properly it is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most south koreans look like and its realism is very painful few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s south korea was in fact more impoverished than north korea and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc but many people still live miserable lives and situation is very similar to that in china where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings

some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants for many asians smell is a way to express utter contempt and this is often directed against the white people who being able to process milk smell like butter and are seen in rac ist light as unclean but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor the poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles like roaches in the dark but in life and death situations resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads

the movie paints a sad picture of modern east asian societies with many subtle points criticizes their culture and emulation of the america with a few cruel but precise strokes the sheer talent of the korean filmmaker but also the fact that west likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in east asia to thrive one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie",6480.0,"[ 3.6589939e-02  4.6592373e-02  2.5346191e-03  1.5247461e-02

4.5,2020-01-30,"its so metaphorical is what kevin says when they show him dasongs paint he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about most critics of this movie say exactly that its so metaphorical obviously most know what you are talking about when writing something about a movie i have to be 100 sure that i have understood

its so metaphorical this comment on this movie is quite fair and precise parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground sometimes leaves it to the publics interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story a clear example is the first time kevin visits the park house the house is shown in a lowangle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way as there are many examples throughout the film the fight over the cell phone in the park house looks like an animal fight the shots in the kims house are closed and in the immense park house they are open and wide a lot of voyeuristic hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs are some simply steps over others who are the real parasites the kims or the parks",6612.0,"[ 4.0806264e-02  5.3252816e-02  5.1524974e-03  1.5205505e-02

4.0,2019-12-28,"there is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce with a large proportion of its population below the poverty line it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from south korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim parasite 2019generates a great deal of conversation but be warned it is not a film for everyone especially those averse to gory endings

if you step back from the storys twists and turns the narrative premise is simple a family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as one by one each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor driver and housekeeper the gullible family is easy to deceive while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage the occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion however the plan comes unstuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences

the film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various subplots and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens but that is not the point of the film director joonho bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege with both sets of family never questioning their place in south koreas social order this acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns korean society to moral bankruptcy

there is more to this film than political discourse as a black comedy it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is lowhanging fruit",4117.5,"[ 3.7598319e-02  4.8812099e-02  5.5853780e-03  2.1573549e-02

they quite clearly cross the line and when i mean they i mean bother the working class and the upper class you could easily argue that parasite refers to one family trying to suck another family dry or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class and expecting them to be grateful about it too there is also something about the american indian theme a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity nature is dog eat dog or is it a homage to an idyllic past where native american culture was relatively classless

3.0,2020-03-04,"this film doesnt allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects many ways to look at is it thriller comedy drama societal critique its all of it and therefore none of it all in all i was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated

the style is there i grant it cinematography is great acting is awkward at some points but its ok because of the partially comedylike nature of this film

but then there is a problem with story telling it builds up nicely toward the middle where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below and then it makes an unexpected turn its alright to make a surprise at the end id even say its good as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line a reveal must make sense once it is revealed this one didnt do the job convincingly for me we are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party

this film is just fine but no masterpiece in my opinion some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting others are so obscure to the point of being pointless great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum unfortunately this one is leaning to the pointlessness",293.75,"[ 4.1396234e-02  5.2305330e-02 -7.0224521e-03  7.8503117e-03

with the hype around this movie best in ten years i had unreasonable expectations this is a funny almost silly story with great acting and with a couple of twists that make it inventive its also filmed photographed with gorgeous care lots of gently moving camera a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually its an example of classic great moviemaking i thought the acting was especially sharp like the complex job the leading woman yeojeong jo had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea and the rest of the cast played types that didnt tumble into stereotypes the story was smart enough to give them room to be complex but this isnt a probing complex movie actually the content is in the improbable situation and how it leads almost in a chaplinlike building of absurdities to comic tension the cameraman kyungpyo hong deserves credit for sure because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenesracing down dingy steps a downpour in the slums and graceful geometry in the fabulous house director bong joon ho deserves the praise he is getting that said the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise its been getting there are more impressive movies out there in various ways even just this year there are movies that have movied me more or made me laugh more or were more inventive im not naming movies maybe since this movie manages all three its notable but ill keep my admiration in place enjoy it",3372.75,"[ 3.8955886e-02  4.7853280e-02 -3.1549621e-03  9.5941434e-03

2 all the characters are pathetically unlikable they only show flaws you dont want to be them you dont want to be with them  not at the beginning nor in the middle nor in the end

3 this lowlife 4member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition the husbandfather was unemployed for a very long time the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times this helpless and hopeless family couldnt simply become a well practiced conartist family overnight if they were such great scammers they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time they dont have money to afford a dignified basic living standard they would not be possible to suddenly become expert conartist so easy and so soon

4 i dont understand what the intention of the director is what does he want to explain or to prove is it a critic of social inequalities is it a thriller a comedy i dont know and none of these styles is addressed adequately",290.0,"[ 4.0358119e-02  5.0227251e-02  4.1861943e-04  4.1612308e-05

2.5,2019-12-31,"this movie is not a masterpiece by any means and all the apparent hype its getting why is it because this is a foreign film trying to be an american film that is trying to be an american genre film

the good
the actors are good
some good cinematography definitely some cool scenes like the flooding late in the film
the twist near the middle of the film is a good twist however its like 50 minutes in and its too late the film is semiboring up to that point


the bad
weve all seen those lessthanstellar films where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another not the comedies where its supposed to be funny or dumb but the serious films and you sit there thinking man these criminals are effing morons its just not believable youve seen those right well this is one of those


i could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision even two but every single one its just not believable because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family but once theyre all in and making buck then they all become stupid doesnt work

the bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping and the criminals decide to hang out get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy familys living room even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a what if next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly really

then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure why wouldnt even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something oh sure one of them eventually does but like 30 minutes later when its too late

the film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes not halfway through the movie",0.0,"[ 4.0992562e-02  4.7858804e-02  1.1831232e-03  5.7578851e-03

ive seen parasite three times in five days i think something may be wrong with me its just so good even after repeat viewings the hightension scenes still hold so many thrills bong joonho has made a perfect film ive seen it so many times ive memorized the characters lines so i can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles this made the movie even more enjoyable i just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie pretty much conversing with myself here but feel free to read oh and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you havent seen the movie

yeojeong jo the performer who plays mrs park is such a gem her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch her face is so expressive and bright there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious she is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultrarich park family

my favorite character is still mr kim played by regular bong hitter kangho song the way bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as hes said song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right this proved to be a real challenge for editor jinmo yang who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work for example song may have had an over the top take but jo may have had her best take of that same scene yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors its seamless to us but to yang thats a lot of pressure personally this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film i worked on good to know larger productions do this too",11887.5,"[ 0.03882087  0.04371969  0.0025971  -0.00183146 -0.00109334  0.00384182

5.0,2020-01-10,"it isnt every day that you come across a movie like this a practically flawless one in my opinion actually i have nothing but praise for director bong joonho and i can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months this is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive dont worry this review wont have any spoilers whatsoever

to begin this praise train i have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor choi wooshik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movieanother standout would be kangho song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by bong joonho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities

a transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie the pacing was consistently on point where everything even the change in tone is seamless along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semibasement house in the suburbs

furthermore another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by jung jaeil which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone i shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie",11106.25,"[ 4.0995788e-02  5.1431179e-02  7.4169849e-04  1.4581359e-02

the kims are another family of four but for reasons we are not sure of live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city none of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever albeit in a machiavellian way for example they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly

the english tutor at the parks home recommends to the son of the kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns this soon snowballs into all members of the kim family shamelessly exploiting the park family and their employees their crimes are as follows

3.0,2019-10-03,"before i attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating i must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for bong joonhos past work snowpiercer was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films which turned out to be every bit as great as snowpiercer was im a huge fan of his and i was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous palme dor win hes a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it and id say winning that award had been a long time coming for him however after my boundless anticipation for this film and finally getting the chance to actually watch it i was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment

ive read many reviews of this film all of them flooded with unworthy praise many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade filled with metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns and unfolds in satisfying unexpected ways leaving the viewer wondering whats gonna happen next the former sentiments mention of metaphors and allegories and the way they are presented in this film have been done countless times over the course of mankinds brief existence and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before marx introduced his theory yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive theres only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a twist in the film which ultimately wasnt that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling besides that moment everything is utterly predictable i dont understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before",464.75,"[ 3.8353018e-02  4.5993201e-02 -1.6188016e-03  1.3595129e-03

it didnt feel forced or silly  it was powerful  edge of your seat  wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the parasite  or someone is to you

4.0,2020-02-08,parasite is a fantastic movie that features sympathetic yet morally gray characters and their plight to earn enough money to live despite the awful things the characters do you feel for each and every one of them thanks to the fantastic writing and acting the humour is also fantastic and always lands seriously despite being a drama parasite is one of the funniest movies ive seen all year however the reason why i cant say that parasite is one of 2019s best movies is the ending the ending is so anticlimactic disappointing and dissatisfying it didnt feel like that was what the film was building towards at all however i still recommend parasite as its mostly a fantastic experience that i just wish had a stronger conclusion,1638.0,"[ 0.04195423  0.0532553  -0.00610104  0.00837292 -0.00019873  0.00710854

5.0,2019-11-22,at first sight i gave 10 but being close to the end of the movie i was thinkingno no 10 but 8 because i doubted how they could miss what was with moongwang and then the story mentioned what was with her and i moved back to 10  the whole concept is great from the story music and photography to acting and style next to that is there are many genres in one also in several moments it drives you to think about many things how would you react gives mockery and shows the human nature essentially,3081.25,"[ 4.31028940e-02  5.36007248e-02 -7.58361956e-03  3.71168321e-03

3.0,2023-05-12,"i had to leave a comment because i have no idea how this movie received an 85 rating 6 range at best as far as korean masterpieces go i thought the handmaiden and the housemaid were far better stories about class the script had tremendous ideas and i was looking forward to them  and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot it felt very messy there were scenes that had no follow up or no point like they had to fill a plot hole last minute if hours of this film were cut that would make sense it felt like it couldnt decide if it wanted to be a dark drama or a dark comedy if it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy you went too far if you wanted to be a intense drama you really dropped the ball it felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe the more i think about it the less respect i seem to have for its artistic merrit absolutely overrated

as im reading throught the miles of reviews im convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year or theyre all paid the common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this another reviewer commented this is the same exact plot as married with children even down to chicago illinois being a factor just blew my mind and now i have even less respect for the script",335.75,"[ 4.0668949e-02  4.7215901e-02 -7.7907736e-03 -6.1098030e-03

5.0,2019-09-29,"i expected a lot from parasite gisaengchung since it won the palme dor at the cannes film festival and because i really like bong joonhos previous films

still it exceeded my expectations its a comedy drama thriller and horror film in one sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained i think parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public

the cinematography and miseenscene are beautiful as it often is in korean films the style is very similar to burning by lee changdong but the story is something else during the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thrillerhorror im not going to say more about the plotstory than that because i dont want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything

this film is simply a must watch no wonder it won the palme dor",6862.5,"[ 4.35270444e-02  5.45545109e-02 -7.81856850e-03  1.64855481e-03

its a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror with a script that handles the theme of the people we dont see because theyre not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion when i saw it in a theater during its new york run i was impressed i was convinced it would be nominated for best foreign movie and might even win",6593.75,"[ 4.0346570e-02  4.9926046e-02  1.0928171e-02  7.1514645e-03

the movie basically portrays class divide in south korea and symbiotic relationship between a rich and a poor familythe rich family is the proverbial host whereas the poor familythe parasite

the beauty of the movie lies a few layers beneath what is actually portrayedhow the parasite slowly befriends the hostand how it gradually morphs into something else completelythink of all the plot twists and their manifestations in societyspecifically the relationship between the owner and the working classjust brings out global sentiments of capitalism going crazy so beautifully

as this movie is being released globallyi am sure the rankings and ratings will further improveit was released in india around 1st febthis movie is a global phenomena considering the times we live inrecommendedjust go and watch this in your nearest theatre",6450.0,"[ 3.59879248e-02  4.52715456e-02 -5.20087196e-05  1.81721244e-02

3.0,2020-02-08,after reading all the glowing reviews especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade i had to see it for myself the plot it self wasnt anything ground breaking and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour the ending was a total let down lots of plot holes that i wont get into here i agree with some other reviewers the park family werent your typical rich snobs the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish but not terrible people by any means all in all just a mixed bag shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema and i highly recommend watching that,196.25,"[ 0.042013    0.05355405  0.00209908  0.00386227 -0.00715216  0.00527873

4.5,2020-01-24,"much like its creature name sake bong joonho s parasite is a movie that latches on to you and wont let go the story of parasite revolves around a poor family that cons a rich family into hiring them and once the poor family becomes integrated to the rich family the selfishness of the poor family starts to threaten everything multiple times in the film we are shown scenes of the humiliation abuse and the depravity of the poor family the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away the shots are there to tell a story and not used as gratuitous fillers for shock value

parasite is a movie that challenges us to rethink how we live our lives and just how deep do we affect those around us",3064.0,"[ 4.28666919e-02  5.82026020e-02  6.83410978e-03  2.14392804e-02

3.0,2020-02-29,"ive often thought that the genre mix of comedy  thriller is the most difficult to bring off somehow the two different kinds of reality in their extremes dont mix easily unless the very nature of the narrative demands it as in dr strangelove

the comic first half is somewhat slow and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family by a streetwise poor one however when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge and so i couldnt believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified

a brave attempt but in the end i was left feeling a bit numb it all seemed to lack any solid centre with serious themes looking trivial and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining all a bit tasteless really",207.25,"[ 3.7355918e-02  4.5575172e-02 -9.0355294e-05  1.5008247e-02

given the premise of the story it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie that aspect of it was very touching

my 1010 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events",3050.0,"[ 4.0803146e-02  5.1029507e-02 -8.6425385e-03  1.8257819e-02

5.0,2019-10-21,"i just watched the movie and found it simply wonderful it is a mix of moments that happen as fun joy tensions and sadness the climax scenes of the movie are breathtaking and all extremely well fitting you realized it was no trick of the script to make those scenes happen everything flowed very well im amazed at the movie a lot of people need to see this work for yesterday

note the counterpoint of the rain scene is because of the rain the rich cant get to camp and because of the rain the poor are obliged to camp in the gym",3300.0,"[ 4.2201679e-02  5.8249973e-02 -1.3282294e-03  1.4839616e-02

3.5,2020-02-13,as one other reviewer said all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie technically it is very well crafted great cinematography great acting but personally i think overhyped in a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor a little bit too stereotipically i might add is bound to get great reviews actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess and social justice folk of twitter feel they have been done justice even if only for two hours on a theater hollywood wants to be that white knight and last year it paraded in their red carpet mexican native yalitzia aparicio this year it was the korean actors ill bet next year it will be another troupé like the rich family in the movie minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to hollywood useful and good while they serve their purpose stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they dont no wonder 202 oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind i dont think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it beware though last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory,1312.0,"[ 3.9315529e-02  4.7807496e-02 -2.9368871e-03  4.5302710e-03

5.0,2020-01-12,"so much to unpack incredibly thoughtful and clean cinematography well written script masterful suspense so many metaphors the music in the suspenseful scenes was so good that you barely noticed it until it was over i was captivated through the whole movie

i thought that there might be some symbolism of north koreasouth korea as well as social class but i havent seen anyone else point that out so it could be me grasping at straws

for the main family the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began minus the father and daughter kiwoo and chungsook are presumably still struggling at the bottom of the stairs again everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away thus describes bong joonhos ruthless realism the poor get poorer and life continues on with no plan to fix anything

overall this is quit intresting to watch  to understand the culture  the limits between poverty and rich people  there is more but i dont want to spoiler it  so it worth to watch

the movie ended in hurry somehow not showing the life of kim kiwoo  i like that for the first time i see quality into this koreanchinesejapanese culture movies recorded 

this movie is pure fiction  but is not feeling like it couldnt become a real thingh  because doesnt look that unrealistic to happen 

i note it for 9  because i would give it a different ending and a part 2  but maybe the director of the movie didnt had same vision as us tend to have   he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to dont end in just a happy end",3392.0,"[ 0.043712    0.05705813 -0.00592207 -0.00476875 -0.00840838  0.00936957

5.0,2019-10-19,"the working class and down on their luck kim family struggle to make ends meet when a friend of the son kiwoos who is an english tutor for the daughter in the wealthy park family has to leave his position he recommends kiwoo for the job now having an in with the wealthy family the kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household but not everything is as it seems in the park house or with their previous servants

this movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family the differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the welltodo having what usually gets termed as firstworldproblems while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood it doesnt shy away or try to be subtle about it but interestingly enough we dont feel beaten over the head with it either which is a major change from the hamfisted approach taken by most filmmakers couching this in a comedy is a good approach as well as the audiences guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas

however i do say its mostly a comedy the third act takes a dark dark turn and the contrast not to mention general disdain and even indifference between the classes becomes much more severe this gets into some hard territory and characters that weve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves at the same time it doesnt feel unexpected almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it but arent surprised by it when it does show up this is some masterful characterization

another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor",12068.75,"[ 0.0409409   0.05066196  0.01013402  0.01696802 -0.01236158  0.00977099

5.0,2020-01-24,an instant classic its a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble somehow these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the top the performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film dialogue is very engaging and riveting it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all the story is well executed and well paced there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes the editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the films atmosphere of tension and ease the statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night overall it is one of the best films i have ever seen and it is one of the parasites i am happy to have in my life,6631.25,"[ 0.04191739  0.05440556  0.00151704  0.01635176 -0.00978297  0.00339417

3.0,2019-12-20,"i think theres a really good movie buried in parasite somewhere but i gave up trying to find it it has the same problem the directors previous the host had the pacing is broken

thats not all though people have written about the movies unexpected twists and turns the thing is it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive they are too few and far between and too unbelievable the first major twist happens about an hour in and seems to come out of nowhere

the parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich parks are the best bits though they are far fetched how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand

but then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly until by the end i wasnt even paying attention

pity some of the sequences were brilliant",211.0,"[ 4.13145833e-02  4.94352877e-02 -1.79471343e-03  4.94755199e-03

5.0,2019-12-02,"i have seen two films previously from the director of this film bong joon ho those being okja and the host i like them both quite a bit i think however that parasite is the best film i have seen from him dont judge this movie on the us trailers i felt they did a really bad job marketing the film they made it look really pretentious in reality the actual movie isnt anything like that trailer this is a dark funny insane crazy and thought provoking film

i wont get too much into the plot as i feel its something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family the kims who try and take advantage of a rich family the parks things get complicated from there

the acting in this movie is phenomenal everyone here gives their a game the directing by bong joon ho is simply masterful the screenplay is smart creative darkly funny like a coen bros movie it reminded me a lot of fargo especially and is pure insanity at points the film doesnt take sides on either family they both do pretty bad things but at the same time you surprisingly care about them despite how flawed both of them are the halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments i have seen all year the movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in korea

the cinematography is beautiful especially those big wide shots of environments the editing is exquisite no scene goes on for too long they make every second of this film matter and i never felt bored by the film the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me the music is also pretty good as well

overall parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year it has great performances amazing direction one of the best screenplays of the year and it keeps you guessing what will happen next go into this movie as blind as you can the less you know the better",11543.75,"[ 4.1951433e-02  5.0412826e-02 -2.9299979e-03  7.2440943e-03

1.5,2020-07-29,"i think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deepermore groundbreaking than it actually is it has the plot of a romcom with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary wow class differences exist thanks bong joonho for enlightening me

just because youve successfully deciphered what the directorwriter sought to convey doesnt mean hes necessarily saying anything profound people need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film its significance remains painfully surfacelevel

i see a lot of people separating this movie into halvesand its fitting during the first half i was fairly interested and as i saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events i started wondering how the hell it had won best picture alongside the universal acclaim

well after the former housekeepers return the stupidity that ensues yesthat moment and the very end inclusive signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise however its here where the film starts to break down for me

we accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening thats ok for some time for some genres but i simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy the existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to and on top of it i genuinely dont care what happens to any of these people save a tinge of regret for mr parks taking a knife to the chest i find it impossible that the tutorson could survive two 2 skullcrushing throws of a rock to the head and i genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than mr",1919.0,"[ 3.8255386e-02  4.7286972e-02 -8.0957118e-04  6.0064360e-03

some people refrain from watching foreign language films i find myself paying more attention to the plot since i have to read what is being said this is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment which this one does

parasite deserves a 1010 because of the very simple reason that i wouldnt want to change a single second of it everything had purpose so watch it i bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews",6787.5,"[ 4.22503166e-02  5.08908518e-02 -1.31011605e-02 -9.03123338e-03

the stairsoh so thoroughly magnificent in the simplicity yet the most complex of metaphors yeah i made myself giggle on that one i was instantly reminiscent of my philosophy 101 allegory of the cavei went down thank you herr hanak

okay ive lost all of you i loved this movie for the best foreign filmmostly because my theater neighbors tonight ate every kind of snack bar food possiblei will have nightmares about the gnawing they chatted and checked their phones throughoutthen they pottied and were able to read the screenand then they seemed confused wonder why

4.5,2020-01-22,for me parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern so that its hard to tell which genre you just saw the script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end moreover the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movies shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters which are all put on with a lot of love,2016.0,"[ 0.04334896  0.05747423 -0.00573499  0.0173134   0.00020995  0.00728017

now directed by joonho bong who also directed memories of murder and snowpiercer parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre its really hard to describe this film i would compare this with quentin taratino films like the title suggests but even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice that aside joonho bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling so much so that at first viewing you wont notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents the name parasite is just one of them at the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are is it the rich the poor their expendable need for a better living or the house itself acting wise i dint see a single false note by any actors the main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by kangho song writing is however what makes this film so great you can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything there is not a single loop hole every character choices make sense everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point

there is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it the social structure with the way we live our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently our priorities and what we value joonho bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened he has completely turned a genre on its head a film about social class has never been made like this before",11981.25,"[ 4.1936766e-02  4.8292469e-02 -3.8402737e-03  2.7965507e-03

3.0,2020-02-24,was expecting a great movie about social inequality i find i usually agree with the imdb rating but this movie was not about social inequality or class status it is about a down on their luck con artist family completely understandable the boy lying about going to university to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for but morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears but then the family lies manipulates and scams two people to get fired deplorable do people do this cause they are poor no its cause they are criminals there are criminals at all social levels so this is not some type of movie about social inequality how disappointing but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers but true to form the scam is threatened to unravel,235.25,"[ 3.9446071e-02  4.7847200e-02  5.3062178e-03  9.4645172e-03

5.0,2019-09-17,"a question in my mind after watching this movie is if im one of these roles and what will i do

parasite presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet the depiction of bottomclass people in this film are both sympathized but greedy although rich people are kind they just cant stand the smell and life quality from bottomclass people and they express their emotion too obviously to bottomclass people this is humanity and there is no correct answer but we can think deeply in this issue and what if you are neither parasite nor host would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing

its very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film",4812.5,"[ 4.16882038e-02  5.00525609e-02 -5.81951253e-03  4.22294391e-03

5.0,2019-12-07,"this movie is just smart entertaining and artistically fulfilling if it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects this would be a very good movie but instead it just excels at all three

the script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining and the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely it is just beautiful

it is difficult to judge the acting when you dont speak the language but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world yet so similar to ours

i just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone whos reading to watch this movie i really enjoyed it and i will gladly watch it again some time in the future",4443.75,"[ 0.0430036   0.0561907  -0.01091814 -0.00048214 -0.00411254  0.00535258

3.5,2020-02-24,"parasite became the first foreign language film to win the best picture oscar the first third of the film had me wondering why

the film opens in a dilapidated smelly semi basement in south korea the kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbours wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected they make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes

dad kitaek is the weak link he cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted son kiwoo gets a stroke of fortune when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma kiwoo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy park family who live in a lavish mansion soon kiwoo gets his sister kijung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son

the wily kijung conspires to get the parks family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother chungsook

all of them claim to be strangers to the park family pretty soon the kims are earning good money and living well they are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy parks

their good fortune is threatened when one night when the parks are away on a break the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind

i thought the movie would turn out to be similar to joseph loseys the servant which was scripted by harold pinter it goes in that direction but then swerves off

when bong joon ho accepted his best director oscar he publicly thanked martin scorsese it was his movies bong studied in film school the key is scorseses own british influences ranging from ealing films hitchcock to powell  pressburger

there is a parasite in the park household but the film is about class a fatalistic metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy",1897.0,"[ 3.7814565e-02  4.5937464e-02  2.3679161e-02  8.0150915e-03

3.0,2021-07-23,"the only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie and let me be clear here not just specifically korean but literally any nonus movie on par with parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as parasite anyway with a bit of luck of course actually not just a bit of luck they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because thats what happened with parasite it is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought thats a lot better than what i expected domino effect followed and today we got this movie thats overrated and predictable no different than your average thriller movie

p s the only reason i went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm the movie is still watchable when drunk",249.75,"[ 4.2276036e-02  5.1910538e-02 -7.6298621e-03 -8.0032129e-04

so not convincing every stretch of the movie i thought i started understanding the characters a bit more but no next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again in the end it made me fail to attach with any of the characters

without enough entertainment what were the film makers trying to tell the audience i completely dont get it

disclaimer this review is in two parts part one will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers part two will delve deeper into the film itself so read part 2 only if youre cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film with that out of the way

part one

parasite is no misnomer it fully lives up to its title as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities i cant go a few minutes without remembering of some image joke line or scene from the film my selfdiagnosis is apt and i fear i may be terminal

i think the best way to go into this film is to go how i went totally blind ive been looking forward to parasite well before it took the palme dor at canne this year bong joonho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece a devilishly wild pitchblack comedy very much domesticated and between two families ill leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story just know this film is in korean so it is subtitled it loses nothing in translation but i really wish i knew how to speak korean so i could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue

the story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper like quicksand before too long youre in too deep the editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by it feels modern sleek and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad

its worth traveling to see with joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities",11468.75,"[ 3.9095689e-02  4.6025213e-02 -8.1184115e-03  1.1825082e-04

3.5,2020-05-13,"parasite is a highly polished and prettylooking movie but it falls short in a few ways my biggest issue was that i couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities and the rich family are basically clueless airheads i really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story the movie also suffered from a severe case of tonal whiplash meaning the tone was all over the place sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously like a straight drama

also in the last quarter the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose this wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised

the movie also has some glaring plot holes like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home i guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film",1129.0,"[ 0.04189746  0.05468476 -0.00254285  0.00892097 -0.00945947  0.00776741

5.0,2019-11-04,"i generally never watch foreign language movies because im annoyed by the subtitles but this movie hooks you up to the screen with its visuals the acting the premise the shifts in the tone you never know whats going to happen next i dont understand korean but still i could connect and realte to the characters after watching joker i wasnt expecting any other film this year to even come near it but this came out like an underdog both are 10 on 10 for me i wish such movies are made more i hope it gets a dub so that more people could watch it if they are not into foreign films this is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like fargo or even breaking bad it has a similar aura to it

i literally dont have any major critic for the film but if i have to nitpick i wish the death of kims son was real because when it was implied at the beginning that hes dead but the later on revealed that he survived takes away the horror of that scene

overall its dark funny horror and sometimes feels like its real what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just dont know it how many mask they wear",6981.25,"[ 4.31767888e-02  5.12206331e-02 -9.28788539e-03 -1.09576927e-02

3.5,2020-01-16,"i tried to watch this movie once and faded out after the first ten minutes its surprising too as the first scenes with the slacker family were very very funny and entertaining it reminded me of the beginning of old boy in a way upon my second viewing i was stunned fully engrossed and entertained all the way through this is perhaps the best film of the year i havent seen little women or 1917 yet

the story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees the rich family doesnt know they are related the poor family discover a man living in the basement who happens to be the former maids husband violence ensues and the movie just becomes more detailed fun thrilling and entertaining all the way through

usually movies tend to drop out near the end or close to the climax i find i usually get bored at this point this film doesnt do that it almost reminds me of fight club with its dark humor and thrills in fact thats the only movie that comes to mind though they are very different films parasite does have its own take on class which is very prevalent it seems the rich and poor are very similar with the middle class not even being presented in the movie

overall this is a tremendous movie im glad i gave it a second chance probably the best movie of the year

5.0,2020-01-05,"i would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes narrated with black humor paradoxes and a hint of absurdity

it is a critique of todays society focused on having on the immediate gratification on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many

its well deserved the film won the palme dor at the cannes festival and the critic describes it as perfection made film

4.0,2020-02-10,"synopsis a poor family in south korea con their way into the home of the wealthy they soon find themselves in the middle of a dark unexpected secret

review this film is truly an original masterpiece from bong joon hos direction to all of the phenomenal acting so intricate and precise it left a really special film positives as i mentioned the directing is absolutely superb bong joon ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film you feel as though your living through what the characters are living through the acting is oscar worthy all around kangho song sunkyun lee yeojeong jo woosik choi sodam park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together the big stand outs to me were definitely kangho and yeojeong i feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing whether it was the build up for kim kitaek kangho song to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of park yeonkyo yeojeong jo you really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance negatives its tough for me to come up with any negatives this is one of those films where i dont see very much wrong at all however its a film i couldnt see myself rewatching more than twice not that its a bad film or too heavy subject matter its just not one of those films i gravitate towards for multiple viewings and thats why i dont have it as a perfect 1010 conclusion this is one of those films i definitely encourage everyone to see at least once its so original and so well told that i know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema it will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film",4268.25,"[ 4.1815732e-02  5.1223390e-02  2.7379314e-03  6.6982675e-03

2.5,2019-10-30,overrated doesnt even begin to describe this film im a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced and so it was with this film sadly it does not deliver like his other works do performances are all uniformly excellent  particularly that of the poor familys father and the house maid of the rich family inventive camera work a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and thenthe story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover as the film crawled towards its conclusion i couldnt wait to get out of the theater by the time its hoping to be ending arrives i had already checked out an interesting failure with a lot on its mind but in the end whats really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isnt truly made i would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place this is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get i keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer paraphrasing a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different  yeah becomes a big stinker,0.0,"[ 4.27512117e-02  5.54169863e-02 -1.16679829e-03  5.48706204e-03

5.0,2020-02-03,"parasite is bong joonho at his best i was at first sceptical when i was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten i was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and i would come out of the film disappointed i couldnt have been more wrong parasite is fantastic it nails a lot of technical aspects such as cinematographyediting and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year these technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by bong joonho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next it covers comedy drama horrorthriller and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems the way it does all of this is so subtle it doesnt go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes it shows us which i think is a lot more powerful it doesnt villanize any one class both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic the acting is also really strong i cant put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort

on the negative end however some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film specifically the birthday party sequence i just didnt agree that this would be something the character would do i still found the actions performed to be entertaining i just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well

overall parasite is a very well directed written and acted film which is enhanced even further by its excellent cinematography production design and editing with great performances from an excellent ensemble parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its oscar praise",11412.5,"[ 4.3421086e-02  5.2959993e-02 -7.3391483e-03  9.3820440e-03

the film opens to the kim family a very lowclass family living in a semibasement in south korea the family consists of kitaek the father chungsook the mother kiwoo the son and kijeong the daughter they all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middleclass lifestyle the house struggles with animal infestation as kitaek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house acting as a bug disenfectant minhyk kiwoos friend offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house a stone which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it

on his final night in town before studying abroad minhyk offers kiwoo his job as an english tutor for the wealthy park family kiwoo declines due to his lack of degrees but minhyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from kijeong who excels with her photoshop kiwoo enters the parks house where the interview is to be held yeongyo the mother of the park family trusts him fully as he becomes an english tutor for dahye the eldest child on his way out he notices a painting by the youngest child dasong kiwoo under the alias kevin from mrs park refers his cousin from illinois named jessica who is actually kijeong kijeong and mrs",11818.75,"[ 0.03818703  0.04865468  0.02482126  0.00826007 -0.00369745  0.02073111

reality is that after all more than half the species on earth are parasites and most organisms are host to a number of them

kim ki taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family membersthe only family income is proceeds from pizza cover makingone evening at dinner a friend of kim kiwoos kim kiwoo is ki taeks son came to visit kiwoo and he gifted his grandfathers a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to kiwoo kiwoo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job and then he starts teaching mr and mrs parks daughter in their home permanently da hye fall in love with ki woo

mrs parks son da  song he is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing kiwoo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist but really shes not one of these and she also enters the house

kim ki  taek tells his family rich people are realy gullible the two kims plan to dismantle mr parks driver and appoint their father as the driver and then the entire kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper kims wife comes to the house of the parks housekeeper and they all continue to work it is here that the name of the film becomes a make sense

kims family life goes well in that house one day mr parks family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his sons birthday kims family gathers at mr parks house that night unbeknownst to park suddenly the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course that night everyone in the house changes their lives",4299.75,"[ 3.9021865e-02  4.8081942e-02  2.9037500e-02  1.3483356e-02

the movie is just okish it has some memorable moments but it does not get you hooked to it all the time actually some parts are quite boring and you can get distracted easily

i dont really understand how it go so much success and won the oscar the direction is ok i cannot say the opposite but performances no way some of them near a series b movie performance more than a movie that had won some oscars

2.0,2020-11-09,"we live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good

however the moral from hans christian andersens story the emperors new clothes is telling ourselves something is good doesnt mean it is and that is very much the case for parasite

in the main the film isnt too bad a poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy the acting is only alright but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say and the viewer doesnt learn much about the wealthy family the film also leaves many unanswered questions such as
what happened to kiwoos friend who went abroad and what did he make of it all at the end
why did kiwoos father do what he did at the end
what was the point of the love interest between dahye and kiwoo
its all a little silly really

the film will appeal to
supposed film critics ie the type who claim certain wines go with certain foods who more often than not follow the norm of other film critics
the eccentric
millennials who
1 wave the flag of support for anything foreign 2 think being politically correct is a political party 3 think transgenderism is choice not a biological state

4.0,2020-02-03,"parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively but this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating if you like movies with social commentary this one is for you it is so good with pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year

it is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story to see the father of the family on the same scene  trying to save everything he has from his flooded house while on the next scene he has to pretend that everything is fine

so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them

finally i think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong its just the situations that makes us react the way we do",2272.5,"[ 4.3106787e-02  5.6783266e-02  4.0314039e-03  1.5919767e-02

5.0,2020-02-08,i tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards parasite just premiered in romania and we just returned home but its two hours since we keep on discussing it enough to rate it with 10 stars which happens very seldom i must admit i am no connoisseur of korean films so i am not entitled to place it here or there nevertheless i am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top is it a satire a comedy a thriller a social fresco a mystery its all of them and then some it kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours it was informative of korean lifestyle it was entertaining it was gruesome it was comic it was satirical it was endearing it was never boring not only the actors are great in it but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast as a traveler around the world i sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film both the favela style ones and the super rich ones every time i was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully not anymore although for my peace of mind i hope not so dramatically parasite made me laugh made me cringe made me question life gave me food for thought what more should i expect from a film to watch it again clearly,8193.75,"[ 0.04153101  0.05222    -0.01070612  0.00150315 -0.00182073  0.01017578

people are raving about parasite im not one of them masterpiece hardly all the characters are supremely unlikable perhaps that was intentional ironically the rich family provoked more sympathy which i doubt was intentional i racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie do you suppose bc it has a sub text i mean of course it has a sub text it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in korea but that is plainly obvious its not subtle actually its not even a sub text it is the text but up against hollywood cinema which rarely has any sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large parasite then is seen as sophisticated

2.5,2019-12-01,"parasite is in my opinion a very korean movie what do i mean with that well i will get into that late but firstly it was directed by bong joonho who is best known for his english language movies snowpiercer and okja both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple they at least try to have an atmosphere they also have a clear message which however show a very naïve perspective on reality even his previous korean language movies like mother and the host are very similar in that fashion parasite however doesnt really show much of that regard neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the korean movies i have seen with the exception of the masterpieces burning and april snow parasite however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the bong movies but thats the only thing good about the movie however maybe besides the production value the movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it it is lacking in many other departments however the characters for example are terribly written they are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring because of its focus on the characters the soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes which shows that the production value wasnt well spend in all places the acting is decent considering the director nothing bad but also nothing extraordinary the story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing

so overall i would say this movie was pretty mediocre thats why i said its pretty korean",0.0,"[ 4.11313549e-02  4.92893942e-02 -5.14030689e-03  1.02626896e-02

4.0,2020-02-01,"parasite is a south korean family dramablack comedy with some great acting and a unique premise it doesnt take long to establish the characters but does well to give us time to get to know them its essentially the tale of two families the kims  dad kitaek kang ho mum hyae jin son kiwoo woo shik  daughter kijung so dam and the parks  dad dongik sun kyun mum yeonkyo yeo jeong son dasong jung  daughter dahye ziso

the kims are poor living in the slums when kiwoo gets a job tutoring dahye at the parks nice house on the other side of seoul even though theres symmetry in the parentssondaughter this isnt an us scenario but rather an exploration of class social status and unconscious biases theres no good guys or bad guys  just a semirealistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there

all of the actors are great with a nice mix of fun and humour with seriousness and desperation the twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions  theres a few different ways it couldve played out not quite a onelocation film but the house does serve as an extra character good score and cinematography the ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet devastating and hopeful",2871.0,"[ 0.03775863  0.04544044  0.01515297  0.01749524  0.000831   -0.00067377

5.0,2020-01-29,"the dark satirical thriller directed by bong joonho began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word metaphor for countless amount of time and as youd usually expect from a bong film the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name  parasite  suggests though it depends on how you take it  what youd like to call it because stairway remains as another option as well how thats the beauty of this two hour long flick why lets discuss

and to begin with theres the plot that on paper didnt particularly make a lot of sense as its expected from a satire in general but the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty giving the film a base to build upon no matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth each and every actors in their respective roles probably have outdone themselves in that regard

on a technical note the cinematography in particular deserves a lot of credits hong kyungpyo managed to capture the essence of two types of korea something which was extremely important for the film in itself while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable the entire setup of the film that provided the innocence and realistic touch deserves a lot of extolling at the end the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together supervised by cj productions and of course bong with a tight budget itd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed ive been by their mindblowing piece of work

but everything aside what packs the ultimate punch the theme of differences of classes and how its showcased through the stairways",11512.5,"[ 3.78548242e-02  4.84103821e-02  1.46409369e-03  2.20054258e-02

5.0,2019-12-06,just wow not an easy watch thats for sure but i loved every moment of it the actors were exceptional the directing and writing was outstanding not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on what i really liked is that there is no good guy and bad guy in this story the one you feel sorry for later you can get really angry at and the other that you dont like at first you can feel for them somehow in the end  at least i did i didnt expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great altogether for me this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem i was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight couldnt get it out of my head i could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on for hours afterwards absolutely a must watch,5081.25,"[ 4.4811577e-02  5.7589028e-02 -1.0779152e-02 -2.7729275e-03

masterfully done in every aspect all of the acting camerawork and design was fitting and never over the top

the plot was wonderfully paced and the organic tension created was very effective furthermore this movie had much to say thematically and did a incredible job conveying those thematic elements while staying within itself

i dont want to spoil even the slightest minor detail so that every viewer can enjoy this movie as we are all only lucky enough to experience one so brilliant every five years or so all i would advise is that you do see it and for those of you averse to foreign films dont let it impede you it truly is the finest movie ive seen in recent memory youll forget it was in korean",5118.75,"[ 0.04045849  0.04974071 -0.01075863 -0.00338355 -0.0007826   0.00168916

2.5,2020-06-21,i am not korean and maybe i cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me in some scenes i saw an actor or actress pretty weak in the next rather strong sometimes i had the feeling they were no professional actors at all and i can judge acting and i know that that was not on purpose the camera work was good i really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes some misleading others very clear would the storyline have been as thorough as that this would be a great movie in my opinion but it wasnt none of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments the dichotomy of a society here in lower class people and the rich worked well yet a little stereotypical the poor were poor but witty the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down no it wouldnt thats what this film tells us its a satire of course for a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a wellthought script like some others here i dont know why this got an oscar for best movie was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win,0.0,"[ 4.2377949e-02  5.2118413e-02 -6.9483384e-03  2.2589138e-03

5.0,2019-10-21,"despite being incredibly edited and filmed beautiful dark cinematography this movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for the surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop with a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest

starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated

do yourself a favor and watch this film",4537.5,"[ 0.03945652  0.04802044 -0.00618386  0.00872357 -0.00450283  0.00895477

its good but not top 50 good

i feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something coolexotic

ask yourself how this film would have been received if set in us or uk and in english  i feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy  farce

definitely worth seeing dont let the hype set your expectations too high and youll enjoy it for what it is",511.0,"[ 4.0517204e-02  4.4845022e-02 -1.3884085e-02 -1.0101461e-02

3.0,2020-04-12,"see while the film is moderately entertaining it is flawed it certainly isnt a masterpiece in any regard

the massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film because the kims are poor we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy the parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy the driver is underdeveloped the housekeeper we feel bad for at first but she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else

so the kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work all the energy and ambition they put into their scheme they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service but their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end are the park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving no is the house any cleaner the chauffeuring all that lifetransforming naw perhaps if the kims presence in the park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax

and the wealth rock symbolism got it if they were so smart they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment so yay never hold your metaphor  as the writing rule goes

and the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient for the kims its one dead two on probation and one scotfree after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide  only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class that is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind yeah yeah the dad gets trapped under the house how was this proper retribution he was never the mastermind his rotten kids were and mainly it was the son who is the agent of everything",464.25,"[ 3.8645428e-02  4.7314238e-02  9.1776550e-03  1.0453780e-02

0.5,2019-08-30,"this had the makings of a fun farce as i watched the first hour or so i thought it could be a madcap hollywood comedy implausible yes but amusing in an absurd way

but then it started to go in weird places some will call it social satire but to me it was just dark amoral and incoherent

the protagonists the family of scammers are profoundly unsympathetic they wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers yet the filmmaker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film

their story also makes no sense when we meet them they are solvenly helpless inept and unemployed in the opening scenes they are scolded for doing a simple job badlyassembling pizza boxes but then suddenly they become master con artists taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family running everything with efficiency and aplomb this is just bad writing not a masterpiece

while their employers were absurdly naive i didnt hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to yes they are silly but they are also hardworking and accomplished they love their kids and in almost every way they are morally superior to the people preying upon them in the directors upsidedown world view their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them the fates of the employers and their original employees dont seem consistent with any sort of moral compass

without spoilers all i can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters previous behavior if the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay unadorned with acting and cinematography it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess",7324.0,"[ 4.11323868e-02  5.22778258e-02  4.01367806e-03  1.45122018e-02

4.5,2020-01-12,"there i said itits the best film of the year for this reviewer and its the best film bong jongho has made to date

but to be fair ive yet to see the irishman 1917 and a hidden life so my opinion could change though i cant see that being likely

the originalness of parasite is what sets it apart parasite twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone theres ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor

class inequality is a theme director bong joonho frequently uses you observe it in his other films snowpiercer okja and even in the first film i ever saw of his back in 2006 with joonhos horror film the host which also starred kangho song who plays kevins father in parasite hes hilariously witty in both films

parasite set in south korea is about a young man from an impoverished family the kims who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family the parks he changes his name from kim kiwoo to kevin to impersonate an english tutor he soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the parks and the family makes it their plan to doso

the film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families when we see the wealthy park family the house is pristinely clean a complete contrast to the kim family apartment which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city

if you like dark comedies then youre sure to enjoy parasite ive witnessed people who dont like foreign films because of subtitlehatred still relish this film

you wont see another movie like parasite perhaps ever well done bong joonho",7304.0,"[ 4.0227223e-02  4.9010176e-02  1.1761050e-02  1.0413579e-02

3.0,2021-01-14,"whats funny is that the parasites in hollywood loved this film because they actually sided with the scumbag poor family

when the point of the film is that they get biblically punished by a flood for acting like demons that scene where shes smoking a cigarette on the toilet is powerful

although much like hitchcock taking it one twist too far at the very end of vertigo the poor dad killing the rich dad at the end felt totally undeserved it wasnt built up to properly it felt like the director just wanted to get to that point but the pieces werent placed to justify it for the audience or the character

if your daughter just got murdered by a fellow poor person why would your immediate reaction be to empathize with the plight of the daughter killer as inspiration for killing the rich guy completely out of left field sure the rich guy called him smelly and sure he was resentful towards him but to murder him in front of everyone just read as extremely false and dumb

i dont believe actual poor people would even like or empathize with this ending this is purely a trashy parasitical rich persons fantasy

its a shame the ending was so stupid because up until then it was a pretty darn good flick",301.25,"[ 3.93649451e-02  4.83260117e-02  4.39607771e-03  4.44558589e-03

4.5,2020-01-12,this is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and i think the best work of bong joon ho yet its a very funny and playful movie you cant pin it down into one specific genre much like bong joon hos other work some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense the premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life one day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an english tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family the poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously what is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life the director shows the irony of life how two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently while watching the movie it was so engaging that i felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot,4584.0,"[ 4.41027917e-02  5.71918115e-02  5.12086973e-03  1.73909664e-02

im just waiting to rewatch it and pick new details

if you do watch it please do it in the cinema and maybe you will get a crowd like mine that bonded trough the laughs and the shock and ended up talking about it outside

and if you end up thinking is overrated its okey but you will still end up thinking about it for days",2968.75,"[ 0.04102717  0.05002612 -0.00663783  0.00426883 -0.00810954  0.00648313

5.0,2020-01-13,"in our current era of film it is commonplace to take a moral stance whether that stance is on human struggles political processes or social conditioning the stance prevails and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us films like elysium little women 1917 these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve

parasite does it differently the film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you so that you dont have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it you think you know who to root for and who is the bad guy

as you keep watching parasite continually pushes your sense of morals prodding you with the question how far is too far and how bad is too bad these questions never give you a break never give you time to come to terms with your answer as bong joon ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in its tracks

parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care",6868.75,"[ 4.0781714e-02  4.9221527e-02 -3.7296214e-03  4.2223711e-03

4.5,2020-01-20,"as many other reviewers have mentioned parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing there are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the endtake for example crossing the line  the rich dad keeps bringing it up he wants his staff to know their place that family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes

sure it was easy yet deceiving to infiltrate their household so cunningly but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upperclass folks they were serving even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesnt fit in despite the daughters fondness for him she might even be in love with him or shes just infatuated

the basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches the upperclass family lives in an incredible house high up in what i presume is seoul when their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all

the party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair the poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around in fact the very man he drives around is disgusted by him

this is a great movie that touches on many subjects i highly recommend it",5296.0,"[ 3.9659299e-02  4.7535721e-02  1.2246833e-02  8.6308904e-03

5.0,2020-01-13,"last night was one of the most thrilling experiences i have had watching a film

i attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house i finally saw a movie i had been yearning for some time i am a little late to the party in regards to my timing of this film but i am ecstatic i got to view it in a theatre i wanted to go in with no expectations because typically i am let down i have a tendency nitpick as a viewer which can make some movies difficult to enjoy i was aware that it had won best foreign film at the golden globes and had received much critical acclaim i cannot recall seeing another bong joon ho film except possibly the host in which case it was so long ago i do not remember either way i was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama with perhaps some suspenseful elements

as i sat in this small cleanly theatre i noticed the majority of people were of asian descent and unless my eyes betrayed me mostly korean i attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd as the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn and drank their cokes i sat there by myself as the only one in my row ready to have a fun experience with whats been regarded as one of the best of the year

the first portion of the movie centers around an engaging korean family who live in a lowerclass part of the city looking for jobs they live in a home that is underground but can still see the street through one of the windows the family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middleaged parents the movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters the first 30 mins is truly a fullblown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing in its own right it is a very effective comedy that had hints of possible dread ahead the hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story",11912.5,"[ 4.03036587e-02  5.17922714e-02 -2.38630571e-03  1.32487924e-03

3.5,2024-05-27,"parasite directed by bong joonho is a masterful blend of dark comedy social commentary and thrilling drama the film follows the impoverished kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy park family leading to unexpected and shocking consequences

the films greatest strength lies in its storytelling bong joonho skillfully balances humor and tension keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout the screenplay is sharp and layered offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy

the performances are stellar across the board song kangho as the kim family patriarch delivers a nuanced performance while the rest of the cast including choi wooshik and park sodam bring depth and authenticity to their roles

visually parasite is stunning with meticulous attention to detail in its production design the contrast between the kims cramped basement home and the parks luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic

however some viewers might find the films tonal shifts jarring and its ending while impactful may not satisfy everyone despite these minor issues parasite is a thoughtprovoking and wellcrafted film that leaves a lasting impression its a unique cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure",1286.0,"[ 3.69482487e-02  4.37773876e-02  9.92749352e-03  3.06347162e-02

basically the oscars are more of a joke with each passing year however in saying that at least they gave 6 nominations to parasite which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for best film

3.5,2020-01-05,i do recommend this film but it definitely isnt the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like the godfather casablanca etc why it received so many accolades is beyond me probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films the acting was fine its the story itself that left a lot to be desired i really had high hopes going into this one at least it didnt fall knee deep into the korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet,492.0,"[ 0.03618403  0.04309262 -0.01113291 -0.0049439  -0.00100265  0.00778472

3.0,2020-11-16,"mrs shullivan and i finally decided to sit down and read english subtitles this 2020 academy award best picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough but to win best picture against a great film like once upon a time in hollywood i think director quentin tarantino was absolutely robbed i guess when the usa is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as harvey weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old usa social justice upheavel the academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the best picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive so why not send some awards to south korea

we heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about parasite and i would agree that the first half was decent enough but the latter half i felt i was watching a cheap version of a bruce lee action film

i really enjoyed the cinematography and the set designs were eloquent but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled sort of like when in the 1939 wizard of oz the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her i cannot honestly say this was a memorable film certainly not academy award best picture worthy and i would not recommend this film as a must see such as the 2019 one upon a time in hollywood is a must see at least three times

i give parasite a decent but no higher imdb rating then 6 out of 10",363.25,"[ 3.8337946e-02  4.6116974e-02 -4.7336570e-03 -8.1854081e-04

0.5,2020-02-15,this movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites  the poor are scam artists lying for money and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids but its a mess of a story not a masterpiece in the real world the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead but this movie doesnt have any depth  the symbolism is amateurish the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic the movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming bumbling psychopaths and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless sorry its an ignorant view of the world it makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become or maybe hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one,3580.0,"[ 4.14771847e-02  5.50599732e-02  3.28098843e-03  1.83473397e-02

5.0,2019-10-20,"i am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from south korea more than lives up to the hype it was the recipient of the palm dor this year at cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews its an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of the past ten years

i wont say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in south korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible extremely wealthy family the narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary the film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in south korean society but also in the world as a whole from there its main raison dêtre expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations the results are shocking startling hilarious and utterly brilliant such results certainly couldnt be achieved without a truly outstanding cast but lucky for us bong joonho has assembled an astonishing ensemble even more impressive is the films character development while the films primary characters are often not the most ethical they are surprisingly likable and multidimensionalespecially when heightened by both emotion and tone youll certainly remember them long after the credits roll

but whats most unforgettable about parasite is that the film manipulates in the best way possible its tone in so many unique and engaging ways that it is able to fully subvert the viewers expectations of not only how the film will go but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions combining laughoutloud witty comedy taut suspense and moments of pitchblack darkness viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years",11875.0,"[ 3.8692761e-02  4.6545211e-02 -1.5195169e-03  1.3941297e-02

4.0,2020-02-09,"just saw parasite for the first time with subtitles for a foreign film from korea this is very accessible for all languages and audiences the actors are all expressive attractive and do a really good job acting the story has lots of universal contemporary components to it of pop culture

for what its worth the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like south koreas city of god or something along those lines what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed wellwritten and pretty gritty

it starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller part mystery without giving away spoilers

i wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating but unfortunately i just could not sorry but i had to question the ease at which the events unfolded and thats not to say that it wasnt fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the perfect range of storytelling the same issue also arose in the second back half of the movie some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10

however other than these two fairly big big enough to deduct two points flaws the script is practically perfect especially for a foreign film the writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate immerse and challenge your mind while also keeping it entertaining they added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made

i was hoping this would win me over for a best picture oscar upset contender but unfortunately it just didnt quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility",4137.75,"[ 0.04079429  0.04941631 -0.00607235  0.00187024 -0.0038373   0.00698064

5.0,2019-10-30,parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though its not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year i have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick the films message is a little on the nose but i dont have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable other than that this film is perfect there is not one bad performance in the movie cho yeojeong park sodam and kangho song are standouts from the film all 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable another aspect i loved was the cinematography the films slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design the films story and themes make this film incredible the story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems its so incredibly tense you never know what is going to happen next and its always surprising to see what eventually happens the film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound the rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family every time this occurs you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense another thing i liked about the film was the score by jung jaeil his score adds so much more to the tension i know im using the word tension a lot but thats what this film is a constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale for me each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat one final aspect i want to touch on is the humor,11237.5,"[ 4.34047803e-02  5.51503822e-02 -1.75855134e-03  1.33842025e-02

2.0,2020-02-14,should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing i really enjoyed bong joonhos memories of a murder and mother unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches the less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father pretentious and anxious mother the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a native american as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set and finally the moody withdrawn awkward daughter the only character with any spark is the previous housemaid the story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls for an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next most notably how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune see the movie and youll see how ridiculous that is the morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened,321.0,"[ 3.7896562e-02  4.5819972e-02  6.9186785e-03  6.8928958e-03

4.5,2020-01-23,"directed by bong joonho parasite follows the members of a poor household kim scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family park by posing as unrelated highly qualified individuals

this movie exceeded my expectations what a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary this movie feels like its moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows there isnt a dull moment to it youre either on edge or learning more about its welldefined characters each is distinct and so well performed i recognized koreancanadian actor woosik choi from train to busan hes looking fine in this too btw xd as the brother kiwoo i may be biased because ive grown to really like seeing him but he was my favorite character in this film i see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father really well done applause to you sir

i loved seeing the scheming involved in this with a name like parasite i thought this was going to be scifi in nature but its not at all its more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives the kim family were some sneaky ba let me tell you and i loved it its like a better version of oceans films sorry fans of that series but with less heisting and more actual manual labour but still a lot of deception showing class division without making the rich too villainlike so seeing as the storyscreenplay was superb its of course coupled with great cameraworkvisual representations and an onpoint soundtrack to back it up theres some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you dont have to treat an audience like they need to be spoonfed information which i appreciate a lot im so glad this film had a us",7492.0,"[ 3.9883651e-02  4.9220838e-02  1.4576296e-03  6.5264772e-03

5.0,2019-12-25,i dont know whether if its just me but each member of the parasitic family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves it is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination onscreen the film starts out portraying the kim family their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich a lucky stone introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait clinging to the narrator throughout the plot the alltoopowerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon one of them leading to the protogonists running away from the affluent parks home after an eventful night this scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers this juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of actions gone too far makes you feel for them the transformation that the narrators father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio economic casteism that is present in our world a brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon,8337.5,"[ 3.9232545e-02  4.9886912e-02  3.9906627e-03  1.3207457e-02

such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end

the struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday no matter the case desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play parasite does away with telling a tale of class greed and the values or family director bong jooho who brought you the host and snowpiercer creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting if you watch youll understand that keeps parasite from ever falling under even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing although it is considered a crimecomedy i found parasite to be a scary type of film think about it manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it no matter how witty andor smart the victim is the horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you getting to the ending which i will discuss briefly without giving anything away is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility its one of those endings that involve so much but that much just happens to work so well in the films favor its haunting its daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark

verdict parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year theres nothing to not like about this and itll sure stay with you after the first viewing",10075.0,"[ 4.0067509e-02  5.2292492e-02 -4.6172119e-03  1.4370157e-02

director bong joon ho screenwriters bong joon ho han jin wan cast song kang ho lee sun kyun cho yeo jeong choi woo shik park so dam lee jung eun chang hyae jin in the movie we follow the kim family who doesnt have much money by chance the son in the family starts working for the wealthy park family he teaches their daughter english now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy park family and then take the jobs themselves

bong joon ho addresses deeper themes but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile the movie is mostly charming until the kim family discovers the big secret of the house

then the movie starts to get darker and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie the title of the movie turns things on its head because what i thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and i got an aha experience parasites are found in all classes of society

from a technical aspect i think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography there are so many beautiful scenes in the movie and its pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big gardenmy favorite sequence is when the kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down and you feel like theyre on board the titanic they must run from the top and down to the engine room what a wonderful sequence and its so beautiful to watch

the cast was fantastic and everyone fit the needs of their roles the characters were wellwritten with the performances complementing that perfectly",7648.0,"[ 4.07437459e-02  5.08551896e-02  1.74863487e-02  1.44655155e-02

the themes are common enough but told in such a way and with such a unique story to be legitimately fresh the subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles but not in this case  each actor transcends language in conveying their character the plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking sad and satisfying finish

the hype is real  definitely one of the best movies of the year and of recent years dont miss it",2716.0,"[ 4.0378969e-02  5.1362362e-02 -4.4837426e-03  1.1922867e-02

5.0,2020-01-09,"last night was one of the most thrilling experiences i have had watching a film

i attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house i finally saw a movie i had been yearning for some time i am a little late to the party in regards to my timing of this film but i am ecstatic i got to view it in a theatre i wanted to go in with no expectations because typically i am let down i have a tendency nitpick as a viewer which can make some movies difficult to enjoy i was aware that it had won best foreign film at the golden globes and had received much critical acclaim i cannot recall seeing another bong joon ho film except possibly the host in which case it was so long ago i do not remember either way i was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama with perhaps some suspenseful elements

as i sat in this small cleanly theatre i noticed the majority of people were of asian descent and unless my eyes betrayed me mostly korean i attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd as the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn and drank their cokes i sat there by myself as the only one in my row ready to have a fun experience with whats been regarded as one of the best of the year the first portion of the movie centers around an engaging korean family who live in a lowerclass part of the city looking for jobs they live in a home that is underground but can still see the street through one of the windows the family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middleaged parents the movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters the first 30 mins is truly a fullblown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing in its own right it is a very effective comedy that had hints of possible dread ahead the hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story",11906.25,"[ 4.03036587e-02  5.17922714e-02 -2.38630571e-03  1.32487924e-03

5.0,2019-12-05,"winner of the palme dor for best film in cannes 2019 to say parasite is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament when you have to spill blood in a film you have to dose it with genius hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and above all understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well

dont get me wrong parasites is not a bloody drama but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art it is a tragicomedy about love life and death it is a film about the joy of living about survival about the family of the 21st century but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many that sick stifled definition confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values it is about real and living families of the planet in 2019 many dispossessed and a few privileged in a game of services and currency exchanges in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence horror and death

although director bong joonho has already made about ten feature films of various themes i only know one of his films the cult fable the guest a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of seoul that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the han river by an american scientist kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus again in parasite bong addresses the family issue opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children to a rich family with the same number of members the moment they cross roads is the basis of the story a third component personified by a housekeeper gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax which is not the end of the fascinating story at this point of the story it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell until the sad final closeup that ends this work",12100.0,"[ 4.05179597e-02  5.65575734e-02  4.86933440e-03  1.99891310e-02

dont get me wrong it was good but it wasnt all that to be honest i thought it was just above average i think i may have liked it more if it was a bit more concise the almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place there were definitely solid moments throughout good acting and a general level of engagement it just didnt super draw me in

i think if i had watched this without being privy to any of the hype i might have liked it more but i guess i was just slightly disappointed regardless this is for sure a fun and thrilling movie that i would still recommend",195.25,"[ 4.1904982e-02  4.7695387e-02 -1.7171321e-02 -1.6696032e-02

all the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human nothing we can do about it

3.5,2019-11-03,"this movie is a vastly overrated film but still had some cool moments it just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit the story is good but it just goes on and on without any real purpose it doesnt really go anywhere until the mid point which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt but it just sort of stops then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes friday the 13th

the biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters they have no backstory they are poor and nothing else they cant even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10 from them they are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers they cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them they go into peoples house and stay there while the people go on trips you just dont feel for them and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers

in the end it had some cool and intense scenes a hot sex scene some cool violent scenes but it is not a masterpiece the story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started snowpiercer is a masterpiece go watch that instead

4.5,2020-02-01,there are many reasons why korean movies are a top notch and bong joon is definitely one of those this lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride the movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events the movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them its a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for which side to take excellent,1824.0,"[ 4.1597396e-02  5.2370474e-02  4.5997321e-04  1.7154748e-02

the director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a godtier build up with twisted plot this is brilliant  you dont have to complicate it in order to get audience attention

3.0,2021-04-16,"while many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached it starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction when the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in she then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases the last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion all these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment i found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it

the performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless the soundtrack stayed in the background and i dont remember any of it

the elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie while i agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that i have very little knowledge about south korea metaphors do not make a movie magically better while telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment the movie cannot stand on it alone i would not have enjoyed or rewatched memento if its gimmick of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer the craftsmanship of memento was really good from both actors and crew i missed the good craftsmanship in parasite especially from the actors",466.0,"[ 4.0581532e-02  5.1703792e-02  1.8360948e-03  1.0473555e-02

ive just recently been introduced to the skorean film industry after a long break from contemporary hollywood movies my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to skorean films i firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big hollywood blockbusters and what ive experienced with korean cinema so far just for reference the korean movies ive seen so far are basically crimedramamystery movies with my top 3 being 1 parasite 2 the chaser 3 memories of murder but there are many that ive yet to watch what all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be areal enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world bfunny with respect to the story and the characters and c weirdly they felt like they werent trying too much i dont know if its just me being sick of all the hollywoods trying to be super cool act but i find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics and i find that very hard to do it really is a thin line i am so excited to have discovered s",11593.75,"[ 4.0050376e-02  4.7652405e-02 -6.7190933e-03 -1.8108803e-03

i particularly loved how the director filmed the locations and used light sound and suspense to great effect

5.0,2019-10-21,"a few moments into the movie you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings

director bong joon ho has dabbled in murder mysteries dystopian science fiction as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh empathise grin and sit at the edge of your seat by winning the palme dor at cannes and hosting sold out screenings parasite had placed bong joon ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema

the best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters which brings me praise kangho sok who plays the father of the kim family making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family

the cinematography in parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of kim familys semibasement house and polished expanse of park familys uptown villa the background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in while enhancing the drama

while parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages it communicates class divide makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves and makes you question who is the real parasite in the movie

watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves",9762.5,"[ 4.04276177e-02  5.37678562e-02  5.89252310e-03  1.80309024e-02

1.5,2020-07-18,cant believe it won both foreign and america best film some sloppy writing for instance the kim family is drunk in the parrks homeall of a sudden they become sober they throw glasses and bottles on the floor then its cleaned up with no one cleaning it when the two kids are under the ottoman hiding theres no sign of broken anything also the ex maid has been hiding her husband in the cellar for years why and shes been moving the big chest to get down there to care for him all these years then when she returns she cant open the secret door so the kim family can see her how did she manage all the years before this particular night the film is very mean spirited and theres nobody to root for except for the poor man who gets killed again sloppy writing the premise is good but the execution is bad oh and the young kid gets strangled and his head is hit with a large rock he recovers with nary a scratch again poor writing movie makes no sense on the plus side the acting is good,983.0,"[ 3.78389619e-02  4.35065813e-02  1.05247973e-02  7.66908983e-03

almost everything about this film was perfect with numerous messages elements and layers

the production and performance were magnificent the humour black comedy was great the pain was real and the cinematography was dazzling

id like to thank bong joonho in person for this masterpiece

poverty and being indecisive can make life a perfect mess and miserable

5.0,2019-11-14,"bong joonho seems to be incapable of making a bad film and this one might be his very best parasite is wickedly funny stunningly tragic and just gorgeously constructed from beginning to end

the visual storytelling here is immaculate the stair sequence in particular is incredibly craftedthe sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right placesthis is probably the bestpaced film ive seen this year theres virtually nothing i could think of to trim

i am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms you dont need me for plot summary theres plenty of that online already though i would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps

the acting is all excellent song kangho continues to be one of the best actors working today the dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other

im not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so ill just say if youre a true fan of film this is not one you can miss this is the type of movie that reminds people why they love film in the first place

5.0,2019-11-02,this is a very rich film with metaphors as the young hero of it might say it is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction writing and acting are very cleverly done the themes of the havenots against the haves and the coldhearted versus the warmerhearted people dominate the plot which is thick there is a lot of symbolism in it who are the real parasites anyway the poor or the wealthy the caring or the indifferent the tone takes a turn threequarters of the way through from frenchfarce style to almost a horror film however it is worth engaging in until its conclusion as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed i can see why it won the palme dor at cannes in 2019 its a gem,4575.0,"[ 4.1654073e-02  5.6355342e-02 -1.4879645e-03  1.9665323e-02

suffice to say its a must watch for anyone who is intreagued by the class decides and struggles of society perfectly framed in a culture of academically hungry people

this beautiful movie crosses many genres and does a fantabulous job of letting you be thoroughly taken into the lives of each character without any judgement to their respective plights

i am left with a silent revilaey that hard work can be a poisoned chalis if it has no real meaning as much as luck and wealth can leave you unfulfilled if you dont look down with compassion

but i can name hundreds of movies that havent even been nominated in that category before with a better story

4.5,2020-01-27,"this film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows the duality between the protagonist family and the rich parks is shown in such a wonderful realistic manner this type of storytelling has been long missing and i hope more movie makers follow in this trend  in their own original way of course

my one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts some scenes last longer than they should this could be a cultural difference in filmmaking as another south korean film i watched had these instances as well still its not enough for me to completely give up on it its a proper thriller american films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade but failed with the exception of get out you laugh youre sent to the edge of your seat you get angry and finally you feel sad you know a movie is great when its able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after youve watched it

im glad south korean films are getting the attention they deserve ive watched other south korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers congratulations to everyone involved with this film you all did an amazing job and im happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level

highly recommend this film and if youre avoiding it due to subtitles or the nonsensible bad reviews youre sorely missing out",5688.0,"[ 4.1299947e-02  4.8402600e-02 -4.8631588e-03  9.5322682e-04

3.5,2019-08-27,"parasite is a south korean movie directed by joon ho bong who also directed snowpiercer okja and most brilliantly mother now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films which is saying a lot

you never know where the story is headed so theres a lot of suspense throughout the film at first youre given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty their wifi doesnt work their basement dwelling gets flooded and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists thats actually one of the things that bothers me about the film all of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims i wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves i wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did poverty isnt enough

even so the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged the conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour after that a curveball is thrown at them as well as us the audience

and again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset im sorry to point this out again but it gets irksome i expected more from the director of the masterpiece mother that is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous despite all my criticisms parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety",1688.0,"[ 4.1422281e-02  5.0517242e-02  2.3589812e-03  7.4309669e-03

i came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next city of god based on the hype its actually on the level of a movie on netflix that id spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking thumbs down

and no i dont know what its like either but i can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey on their fierce face i dont see any extra thoughts no concerns about ethnicity pain or morality but the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner

5.0,2019-05-30,as a longtime fan of bong and song i always knew this pair would make it at cannes someday and finally _ naneon bongiiyah i purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and im glad it turned out bong had made up for okja very successfully also id like to add that moongwang the former housekeeper was ridiculously good despite all the laughs throughout the movie its quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical absurd society where we live in all the way back home i hope bongs next movie would be just as good as parasite,3618.75,"[ 0.03957251  0.04744982 -0.00321804  0.00133377 -0.00037104  0.0104779

a great start it holds your attention incredibly well i enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film i know some didnt it just moves you into a totally different place

youll laugh and cry youll lose yourself in the wonder do yourself a favour and order it 1010",3550.0,"[ 3.9803769e-02  4.7125813e-02 -7.4296035e-03  1.3146043e-03

4.0,2020-02-08,i dont watch many nonenglish language films but i think parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film although i dont see it as a masterpiece i think there are a lot of highlevel elements of filmmaking in this the plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings the acting is great as well as the direction but im always feeling like im missing the full experience when subtitles dont convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references but that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country 810,1406.25,"[ 0.04261873  0.05455787 -0.00697302  0.00395839 -0.00092846  0.00991972

5.0,2019-10-30,thats the whole point ive seen some reviewers here say that the poor family infiltrating the rich family so easily and skillfully felt like a feel good movie to let us root for the underdog people and cheer for them when they succeed the directer clearly intentionally led the plot to be such so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morallity of the rich and poor families are the rich really evil for ignoring the poor does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them how people dont get the point of social commentary and only focuses on plot details and improbablity is just sad,3887.5,"[ 4.15428691e-02  5.20438664e-02  7.58448942e-03  1.59314573e-02

3.0,2022-05-20,"so i finally watched parasite while the film was not bad and had a different view on social disparity between rich and poor i still think that this film did not deserve to win best picture at the oscars

for a best picture type of film i expect more top visuals scenery camera sound effects music mixing wardrobe and of course great actors and a really great story while those actors werent especially bad they were not great either especially the rich woman acted over the top

now the story for me this story was unfolding to easy too cheap at the start of the movie the poor family is depicted as lazy and especially the parents seem to have bad manors there are those kind of poor people that got hit hard by economy and try to work their way up again and there are those that just live on the money of others and are not willing to work hard themselves the family in parasite falls into the second category they are not even able to fold pizza card boxes correctly nor do they care to present good work results or make a good impression to keep their jobs yet this same family is able to get jobs at a rich familiys home and those rich people the father is a business man  so not a dumb person arent suspicious or realize that they are impostors the lazy woman from the start now runs the whole household as a maid nor do they ask their rich friends or business partners if they know someone for a drivers or a maids job nope they just pick the first one that someone unknown recommends that worked for them for just a few hours

the worst about the story i could not sympathise with the poor family in the end it was not like yeah they were treated unfair by society and had to live a poor live in the basement they deserve better in contrary especially when they found out that the former maid has hidden her husband in the basement for several years this parasite family does not connect with those people",478.25,"[ 4.1519254e-02  5.0131597e-02  6.4114789e-03  7.0234518e-03

4.5,2020-01-25,"parasite is if not the best definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019 the film is almost perfect in every aspect possible

both the cinematographer kyungpyo hong and the director bong joonho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts these three aspects together result in one of the most eyegrabbing movies of the decade every shot is at the same time beautiful and meaningful to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues

the screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film bong joonho and han jinwon came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny interesting sarcastic sad and verisimilar the movie shows the difference between classes like roma 2018 but has the rhythm and its core similar to get out 2017

every character is important and has its moment of protagonism due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay none of the characters is a villain or a hero the only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones

the acting by all the main cast is sublime but the highlights are kangho song and yeojeong jo kangho plays kim kitaek father of the kim family he captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie making his characters arc of development the most interesting of the film yeojeong plays yeongyo mother of the park family she is the complete opposite of kitaek shes naive and has and seemingly has always had an easy life shes clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the kim family

last but definitely not least the music",7340.0,"[ 4.12469544e-02  5.41696213e-02  8.67442787e-03  2.01085135e-02

you might think thats the story its not just when you think you know where the film is going  a gentle comic tale with farcical elements  the movie takes a sudden left turn into the twilight zone

to say more if youve not seen the film would be cruelty beyond measure its a truly astonishing script by writerdirector bong joon ho and my nomination for the oscar for best original screenplay

its the details that get to you this will be a superb film to watch multiple times there are fabulous details scattered throughout you know how the more expensive the car the more solid the clunk is as you shut the door listen to the sound effect when the park front door shuts look what happens to the one of a kind lucky rock",11518.75,"[ 3.7586357e-02  4.4048961e-02  2.0424051e-02  1.6682134e-03

3.5,2019-06-21,"9 star rating from yms and a palm dor what have we here a dark comedy from a great korean director going back to his roots nois ill make sure i pay close attention to this one

as expected this film is good however it could have easily been bad if not for the brilliant cinematography strong directorial sense and most of all thought provoking messages and philosophies that dont hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society however you arent here to see me laud you want to know why i dont hold it in as high regards as everyone else

the film feels messy although the comedy is often effective i dont think it fits well enough in this context the story is innovative though it does feel familiar in certain parts the sudden mood changes arent my cup of tea as well

a lot of the plot points are just too over the top they can be distracting they can be too weird especially regarding the climaxending youll know what i mean there are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end or maybe i need more time to think about them who knows lastly the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in

it is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers at the end of the day ill still highly recommend this film because after all it is a good film and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture but im still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much i guess im not too appreciative of korean films considering my 710 rating for the handmaiden but this is open to change and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me i may learn to like it much more than i do",1693.0,"[ 4.0472686e-02  4.7851127e-02 -7.7368016e-03 -2.4588061e-03

i watched parasite out of curiousity after it won the oscar well i watched half of it and fast forwarded through part the trailer repelled me so i decided not to watch it before this point the cinematography was wonderful but once again my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film i found the movie sadistic and disturbing rather than a provoking statement about class i saw a dark sick film laced with contempt gratuitous violence caricatures of people and unlikeable characters with no moral compass how utterly depressing",2272.0,"[ 3.90187614e-02  4.92509492e-02 -1.03925895e-02  6.39702938e-03

5.0,2020-02-02,its been a while since i watched a movie that made such impact on me first of all i really liked the story of different social classes despair greed deception pride and prejudices it is masterfully directed by bong carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing parasite cant be categorized in a specific movie genre rather its a mix of dark comedy drama and thriller which is its strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres this is movie that i will gladly watch many times a real gem of korean cinematography,4312.5,"[ 4.16548438e-02  5.00677750e-02 -1.13161970e-02  1.89834405e-02

5.0,2020-02-04,one of the best movies ive ever seen this movie is full of wonderful surprises the scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as its overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in mr parks house also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satiricallaughed out loud i have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movieit also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the park family although they are deceiving them the whole movie took me by surprise and i didnt see any of it coming its really clever i laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so the director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off i also have to admit i was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed its a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality meritocracy social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you dont have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie this movie is for everyone satirical metaphorical genius paradoxical impulsive genuine watch this movie,9937.5,"[ 4.05127406e-02  4.93093655e-02  1.59459002e-03  4.85773385e-03

4.5,2020-02-02,"rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet sets up a standard feel good movie scenario seemingly innocuous parasite captures the lively trials of the kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment starting an invasion of sorts the web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible park family opens a series of mouth watering doors but alas theres always some that should remain shut

whether its borders classes or smells everyone has a line that once crossed destroys most semblance of rationale parasite brilliantly dissects how these boundaries however personal and subjective are developed within our very complicated and unique species

filmed almost exclusively within the two families domiciles one a filthy cramped basement apartment the other a glorious spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill parasite offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling

delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies hammer throw expertise american indian infatuations and wifi signal hunting are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act sides are drawn early on making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare but not everything on screen is black and white the consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film what is good what is evil how is that line drawn

sneaky powerful perfectly paced funny shocking and quite wonderful can a film be both dark and bright yes yes it can

3.5,2024-06-02,"reviewing this movie is a unique challenge for me as a japanese person ive always had a special connection to asian cinema even if i havent always been a fan of the style my interest in korean and japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles its not that these movies are bad its just that my preferences lean elsewhere

however there are exceptions one korean movie that truly left a mark on me is oldboy if you havent seen it yet i urge you to skip the hollywood remake and dive straight into the original this movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling

the same feeling applies to parasite again i need to become more familiar with the director and actors i went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises awards and the surprising oscar nomination for both the best international movie and best movie categories of course i had to check it out

when i first sat down to watch parasite i had no idea what to expect the movie starts off like a sliceoflife soap opera a slow burner that gradually builds tension but as the story unfolds the tension escalates leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat

i cant speak too much not to spoil the surprises and twists and oh boy there are many twists to this plot its best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised

overall the directing is superb the screenplay is not complicated and its very well written the acting is also competent mixing moments of comedy and tension very well but it feels dry if it makes any sense

this is definitely only a movie for some and as i have minimal exposition to korean filmmaking i dont have many other references than oldboy and the rest of the vengeance trilogy movies which im not too fond of so much but oldboy has such a visceral punch that its hard to forget even years after i watched it",1932.0,"[ 0.04121085  0.05205082 -0.0084725   0.00065498 -0.00059386  0.00845412

0.5,2020-02-16,i was excited to see parasite due to rave reviews and it winning best picture i was warned by a theater worker that the first halfhour is slow but then it gets really good so i made it through the first halfhour and kept waiting for the really good part only to find out that it was the exact same more tedium by a family that was not really likable the violence was not necessary either and seemed to be a way to make it oscar worthy a lot of oscar nominated movies have violence at the end and that seems to be a way to get more respect or something it was sad and horrible in my opinion i cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie compared to 1917 little women and once upon a time in hollywood won best picture honestly what is going on with those who vote that vote for this drivel it was okay dont get me wrong but thats allmerely okay for the record i love movies with subtitles and have seen several amazing ones but this was not one of them,3836.0,"[ 0.04284569  0.05484449 -0.00739955 -0.00610382 -0.00456905  0.00925057

5.0,2020-02-04,"bong joonho is a south korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film the bong hive being the name of his devoted fanbase his latest film parasite gets a long awaited release in the uk and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make

all unemployed kitaek song kangho and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous parks as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident

parasite is an absolute triumph from bong joonho his film building and building to a crescendo that i didnt see coming at all its a brilliantly written film the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking theres a real intricacy to the screenplay cowritten by bong and han jinwon taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hardhitting

it isnt just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy the production design on parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold the time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the parks family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its mazelike features almost serving as a character itself hong kyungpyos sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lowerclass neighbourhood where the kims actually live is beautifully neat and yang jinmos score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess

coming to the performances parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season its very much an ensemble piece each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the standouts for me were song kangho park sodam and cho yeojeong",12062.5,"[ 3.9044205e-02  4.8506029e-02  9.3430262e-03  1.8500153e-02

5.0,2020-02-03,"parasite impressed me enough that i wanted to see it again having done so ive increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10

what i thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that i had missed in my initial viewing and with the element of surprise gone i could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives i especially liked that no one here is 100 blameless or 100 evil that kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life i only wish it were more common in movies

this time i also paid much closer attention to the films abundant symbolism admittedly though i still couldnt figure out the significance of the scholars rock but that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film

if not the for the irishman i would root for parasite as this years best picture winner still its a shooin for best foreign language film",5493.75,"[ 3.9528869e-02  4.6441022e-02 -1.1471325e-02 -1.2262215e-02

5.0,2020-02-08,"what is parasite  a satire sarcasm humor emotion human condition suspense thriller social issues drama thought provoking dialogues strong and smooth acting  all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style

it is an unconventional storytelling it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor the beauty of cinema lies in its frame because thats the window through which we watch and experience the story and thats where comes the cinematography and the production design it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision  every frame every shot is unforgettable another unconventional part of this movie is its background score we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos may be the background score is inspired from hitchcock movies

this film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching it stays with you even if you want you cant escape from them then slowly you learn to live with them in your head because you are also one of them it is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again probably because you want to laugh cry and get scared  all at the same time

parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence kudos to director bong joonho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world",9850.0,"[ 4.0396940e-02  4.7569551e-02 -6.0016923e-03  1.3514730e-02

3.0,2024-08-19,"ive wanted to watch this for a while because of the high praise it has gotten however i think this made my experience worse because i had such high expectations i felt a bit underwhelmed by this movie

personally i thought the first hour was unimaginably boring supposedly this is part comedy i dont know where the comedy part was to be honest

the pace picked up in the second part but im not sure if i liked this much better our main characters suddenly became so incompetent it made the plot go into a bit of a weird direction

i have a conflicted opinion on this on one hand i can tell this movie had some real skills behind it the camera shots the acting the details everything was thought through and that was quite obvious for example i did appreciate the progression towards the dads breakdown the way we get little details on mr park although nice at first we get more clues on how he sees his staff as less than him the way he held his nose as he picked up his keys

also the very subtle hints at that the family is basically useless at everything making you wonder who is really the parasite

so i get it the symbolisms metaphors the cinematography was skillful

but if i think only 10 was wowworthy that doesnt make up for the other 90 maybe it needed that 90 for that 10 but the 90 was just not enjoyable if a movie is not enjoyable it defeats the purpose of a movie movies can be an artform but its still supposed to give the watcher a good experience in this case it just didnt give me that as much as i wanted it to",382.75,"[ 4.1881159e-02  4.9628675e-02 -4.9352665e-03 -7.0482139e-03

4.5,2020-02-11,"glad that i watched this movie before the oscar nominees were announced i feel a number of people judge it harshly bcos it won a film over other equally excellent movies

in my opinion its definitely one of the best movies of 20192020

excellent performances and a harsh view of people at the bottom

the movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end

sad open ended finale

4.0,2020-01-26,"this films ranking here on imdb is somewhat of an anomaly usually when a hot new release makes its way into the top 250 it manages to remain in its general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote parasite entered the list in the mid fifties if i correctly recall and since then has managed to improve its position to 26 as i write this no one knows if that will hold obviously so im curious to see how the movie rates over time

having stated that i thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the kim family maneuver its way into the life and home of the park family what was questionable to me was why the kims werent able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when min seojoon park suggested the tutoring job to kiwoo woosik choi each of the kims demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long its not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition because once that ambition kicked into gear there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the parks not that it wasnt done by underhanded or devious means but with those kinds of street smarts they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood but that was the set up so you have to go with it

where the story begins to go off the rails is when the kims luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak personally i would never have allowed the former housekeeper moongwang jeongeun lee unescorted access to the park home when she came calling to rescue her husband though it revealed the hidden areas of the park home they would have been discovered by the kims had they followed and observed moongwang to begin with",4126.5,"[ 3.9712045e-02  4.9446743e-02  1.0061314e-02  2.6493538e-03

5.0,2019-10-27,"so you think youre going to fast track your way to the good life huh by taking a short cut here a little lying and deceiving there

well maybe it seems to work for some why not for you i mean how else did they get there right by being honest oh please

so you decide to take the easy road one lie opens one door then another and yet another

things seem to be going so well for you youre getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices all of this unearned wealth is just within your reach

but one night

lightning  thunder 

comes a flood

and the entire foundation your life is built on washes away

turns out all those lies short cuts and easy way outs were not good building material

you had the wrong plan you walked the wrong path and you made the wrong sacrifices

you thought you were taking the easy way out the short cut

look at how wrong you were

in the end you lost everything your sister your father your home your freedom your health

tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out

my god would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start

i guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow

so today i have a new plan i will go to university study graduate i will get a job and work very hard i will become rich and i will get back the house and one day you will walk out of the basement father and we all be reunited in the sunshine of the courtyard

4.0,2020-01-22,"when it comes to foreign films i tend to be a little biased or lenient they are such a welcome break from traditional hollywood when i see a decent foreign film i cant help but want to praise it more because they dont have the multibillion dollar hollywood machine behind them usually they have to be more creative more ingenious and more resourceful

parasite is one of very few korean films ive watched in my life my foreign film bank consists mostly of chinese kungfu movies of which jackie chan and jet li probably occupy the most space korean films are a rarity for me this suspenseful thriller by bong joonho deserves all of the accolades it has received

what i knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them that is essentially what happened but youre not holding anyones attention with that concept alone each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable as the movie developed and we saw the kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the park family we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script

how do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either some how parasite did that the kim family certainly was shady and underhanded but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead the park family was wealthy yet unlike your average rich movie family they were not cruel or unbearable people in fact they were very likeable

normally we want our clearcut good guys and bad guys we want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose in the cases where all of our guys are good we want them all to win in the cases where all our guys are bad we want them all to lose in parasite not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners",4095.0,"[ 4.1664440e-02  5.0846487e-02  9.2942594e-04  4.4167726e-03

this film must be seen by anyone who loves movies it is one that will stand the test of time hollywood be worried with your generic formulas korea is the new power house and parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right american audiences should read subtitles for once this movie will make you laugh and cry the story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle its a must watch a masterpiece",5318.75,"[ 3.96366008e-02  4.88159098e-02 -8.31584260e-03  7.90586229e-03

5.0,2020-01-26,"bong joonho is a director that ill definitely check out more i loved snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone parasite is nothing short of genius

its best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what i can say is that parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible this film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions there are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent bong joonho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible

the story of parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety bong joonho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch their motivations and state make them believable to the audience the events that unfold dont come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing

aside from the story this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019 the colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous there is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic the editing is fantastic as the films pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever the aesthetics on the whole is top notch

i thought knives out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of parasite is extraordinary everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles

i really tried to think of flaws but as of now i could not find any everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense",11218.75,"[ 4.14294600e-02  4.96353284e-02 -4.00312105e-03  1.29742641e-02

parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received that i saw this in a packed theater with an adoring fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart its cinema at its best

3.0,2022-07-20,"finally got around to watching this movie even though being a long time korean movie fan

unsure how this won an oscar and has such a high rating thought the same with spirited away appears that these movies won oscars for being different to the hollywood norm i think so anyway

it was a fun watch but not the best of movies like others would suggest if you have seen many korean movies before you will understand that they dont follow the typical hollywood formula watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing korean movies

overall this is worth a watch for sure but it isnt the best of any genre imho",158.25,"[ 4.1885462e-02  4.7737852e-02 -1.1010764e-02 -1.0279441e-02

4.5,2020-01-16,watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier but great film making and writing can instead turn that into a bridge and such is one of parasites strengths i never felt out of touch with what was going on because i didnt understand that culture or anything along those lines and thats why i highly recommend this movie to anyone parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general visuals never dissapoint the movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous the twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining ive seen in a while there isnt much else to disect just go watch it,2672.0,"[ 0.04168991  0.04875016 -0.00982085  0.0051192   0.00029141  0.00734836

5.0,2020-01-03,"pros

every single thing

the acting is great the pacing is amazing it always feels like something is happening and you wont get bored the message isnt scream out at the audience you need to read between the lines the characters are well developed theres no hero or villain you can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do there are violence comedy action suspense and romance honestly i wasnt expecting much and i find myself really

cons

not for me but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying but read some reviews and probably you would understand whats the message behind the ending",3993.75,"[ 4.00540344e-02  4.17612344e-02 -8.56869202e-03  4.03002370e-03

3.5,2020-02-14,"the scene where the old maid arrives in the video at the door after the doorbell ring was so creepy and i loved the scene where the family is getting drunk and talking around the table after dinner the montage with the peach was also masterful as was the way many scenes were filmed styled and handled i loved how the old maid also got them on cell phone video proving they were all a family and knew each other and then blackmailed them temporarily

the young kim family sister is an extremely talented actress and so is the parks pampered wife the other actors were all solid as well the story is universal and pop cultured so it is relevant and easy to follow for all languages and nationalities

the movie is never uninteresting even when it slows down a little in its final half hour or so it remains intriguing but this is the only part that i felt that could have been a little bit better i also had some questions about the incident at the parks outdoor birthday party regarding why something happened the way it did

the suspense really worked also outside of the mentioned scenes and the humor was usually landing the artsy shots and creative decisions all worked within the story this is a solid movie for 2019 and deserves the oscars",1245.0,"[ 3.9900962e-02  4.9334213e-02  3.2570155e-03  1.1626960e-02

1 its a literal dark comedy movie although it discusses a non sensitive concept thats actually thrown every where on media

2 the economic gab wasnt about the evil rich or the fighting poors and has nothing with specific country u politicseconomy

3 the balance between reality and fiction that makes ur mind wonder instead of watching the same senario

4 best plans are those never existed

5no one of the poor blamed anyone for being like that or even wondered what if

0.5,2020-02-27,"anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece is incredibly dimwitted ill be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast

1 infiltrating your entire family into the rich familys house

they say its hard to cover up one lie you know whats harder covering up a whole lot of them and thats what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly all 4 family members had to fake their identityqualifications pretending to not be related to one another when they are while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up the kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time

2 kevins best friend problem

your best friend has gave you an opportunity to earn some cash to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad he also tells you that hes coming back and will ask the richs family daughter out who he was tutoring he has specifically told you that hes interested in her he also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldnt

what do you think would happen when your best friend returns when he comes back to find out he has lost his job had his girl stolen right under his nose by his best friend and also finds out the best friend he confided in who has broken your utmost trust had his entire family infiltrated the rich mans family working under false pretenses

a is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you b expose you and your entire family

apparently kevin must have thought the answer must be a

anyone care to tell me the answer is b they would be exposed who would have thought about that right
