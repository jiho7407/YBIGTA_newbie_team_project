"its not really a review but my attempt to explain how i interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated especially if the reason is that they didnt like the second half of it

its much easier to understand the message of a movie when the good guys win or the bad guys get punished in the end im not saying that all hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values but still i believe that parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which theres a character with a clearer moral center whom audiences can easily relate to so i think its no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences

some complained that they dont understand kitaeks motive for killing mr park but to fully appreciate this you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is crossing the line

its a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other peoples privacy or as one should mind ones own social position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position if interpreted as the latter meaning it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families respective dwellings

it would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner but the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if bong joonho chose such a path and he is too good a director not to see such a danger

instead he chose to make mr park a reasonable enough character despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature",5.0,2019-10-18,imdb
"i am remarkably stingy with my 1010 ratings ill be the first person to acknowledge this of the roughly 2600 titles ive rated on here only 34 have a 10 parasite is one of them if this isnt a masterpiece then i dont know what is

im going to keep it vague on the plotfront because i didnt know anything about it going in and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying unexpected ways

what i will say is that this film more than just about any other ive seen put me through so many different emotional states during its 132minute runtime and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent parts of this movie were hilarious parts were heartbreaking other parts were insanely suspenseful im honestly not sure if ive felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of breaking bad way back in 2013

and it does all this while being perfectly paced beautifully directed and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast all the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree the amount of conflict drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering you come to care for just about all of them

im stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie and sure ive seen many movies that are hard to fault but its rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect its extremely entertaining thoroughly moving in so many different ways and as icing on the cake theres a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movies over and this ones not going to leave my head for a while i can tell

catch this one when you can and believe the hype joonho bong has made many great films and so far no bad ones but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others",5.0,2019-07-05,imdb
"i cant remember the last time i saw a movie that contained as many genres as parasite the movie starts out almost like an oceans eleven heist film and then expands into a comedy mystery thriller drama romance crime and even horror film it really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too

i love a film that respects its audience there are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats there are a lot of layers to this film and i suspect for this reason its rewatchability factor will be very high

the film was incredibly entertaining too i cant think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening at least in terms of action fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this i had a great time with parasite and i think most that give it a chance will too",4.0,2019-10-06,imdb
"in a meritocracy success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve itthose who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination anyone can rise to the top and for some lucky cinderella plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society i started with nothing and ended up with everything i ever desired you too can achieve you dreams if only you try

the promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition backstabbing deceit and callousness you climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one and then perhaps when you at last feel secure you can afford to be kind and confident and generous its easy to be nice when youre rich the mother in this film jang hyejin at one point observes

but its a very long and very crooked ladder and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip and sometimes theyve been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked downeither by those above you or just as often by those staring up from the ground below there are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder

but in a meritocracy you cant blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it no you must blame yourself you should have tread more carefully you should have climbed more quickly you should have used a firmer and more precise grip anticipated disasters and known just when to leap if you fail in a meritocracy its all your fault you should have tried harder better luck next time",5.0,2019-08-25,imdb

"as a film about a family imposing on another and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface parasite achieves what jordan peele set out to do with us tell a multilayered story in a widely entertaining manner but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative

thats not to say that us is an ineffective film by any means but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare writerdirector bong joonho is in a class of his own

the film follows a lowerclass south korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upperclass family and their lavish household as their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances

its a twisty satire on socialeconomic disparities in south korean society that swings broadly in tone and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts

however to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride",4.5,2019-07-02,imdb
the film is interesting but thats about it the first hour was really slow the whole class thing seemed quite familiar im not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film maybe since it was korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to see the light anyway the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line i would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like young and the restless or days of our lives overall im more critical of the critics than of the film i recommend seeing this its worth a look but all the oscars and best film of the decade stuff is incomprehensible,3.0,2020-02-19,imdb
do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots anxious during many scenes do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who youre rooting for regardless of your answers see parasite parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears the symbolism varies sometimes it is obvious bong joonho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out but other times it is more subtle and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after bong joonho is a master at that the conversation that it sparks is worth the 1320 it costs to see the film parasite has made me think more than most films ive seen give it a watch see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations,5.0,2019-11-05,imdb
"it was entertaining with good execution but best picture

some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer

others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for  while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical american narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status to its credit i think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewers emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively nonvirtuous and indeed villainous what seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane this incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect

now many are praising the supposedly deep revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle but i dont find it nearly as profound as is claimed the overtly sensational absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message and the storyline even leaving aside the overthetop scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction more importantly the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a onesided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of classdeterminant normalcy it strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue even in momentary antithesis yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one and also an implausible one because the world is not so onesided and simple for this reason the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics",3.5,2020-04-12,imdb
there are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot along with comedic dialogue but thats it its not a metaphorical masterpiece that some critics and users are saying i feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of south park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants,2.5,2020-02-27,imdb
parasite is an excellent effort from korean director bong joon ho a talent ive long admired since seeing the host over a decade ago hes had his ups and downs over the years although theyve generally been ups rather than downs but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece its a quiet and reflective work his maturist yet a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way the issue is universal which is why this film did so well abroad and at the oscars although ive been championing the quality of south korean cinema for a long time the technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax a film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think,5.0,2020-11-01,imdb
"this is a movie about a class struggle in south korea like what movie us attempts to do but done properly it is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most south koreans look like and its realism is very painful few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s south korea was in fact more impoverished than north korea and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc but many people still live miserable lives and situation is very similar to that in china where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings

some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants for many asians smell is a way to express utter contempt and this is often directed against the white people who being able to process milk smell like butter and are seen in rac ist light as unclean but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor the poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles like roaches in the dark but in life and death situations resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads

the movie paints a sad picture of modern east asian societies with many subtle points criticizes their culture and emulation of the america with a few cruel but precise strokes the sheer talent of the korean filmmaker but also the fact that west likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in east asia to thrive one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie",4.5,2020-01-16,imdb
"its so metaphorical is what kevin says when they show him dasongs paint he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about most critics of this movie say exactly that its so metaphorical obviously most know what you are talking about when writing something about a movie i have to be 100 sure that i have understood

its so metaphorical this comment on this movie is quite fair and precise parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground sometimes leaves it to the publics interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story a clear example is the first time kevin visits the park house the house is shown in a lowangle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way as there are many examples throughout the film the fight over the cell phone in the park house looks like an animal fight the shots in the kims house are closed and in the immense park house they are open and wide a lot of voyeuristic hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs are some simply steps over others who are the real parasites the kims or the parks",4.5,2020-01-30,imdb
this movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families one very poor the other very rich how their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half then in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread  and perhaps even enjoy though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the moviemaking skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes if you see only one foreign language film this year this should be it exciting and provocative throughout it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away deserves all the accolades it has already  and surely will continue  to receive,5.0,2019-11-04,imdb
"there is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce with a large proportion of its population below the poverty line it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from south korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim parasite 2019generates a great deal of conversation but be warned it is not a film for everyone especially those averse to gory endings

if you step back from the storys twists and turns the narrative premise is simple a family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as one by one each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor driver and housekeeper the gullible family is easy to deceive while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage the occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion however the plan comes unstuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences

the film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various subplots and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens but that is not the point of the film director joonho bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege with both sets of family never questioning their place in south koreas social order this acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns korean society to moral bankruptcy

there is more to this film than political discourse as a black comedy it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is lowhanging fruit",4.0,2019-12-28,imdb
"what an amazing film clearly an essay on the class divide writing lovable but nasty people is tough but perfectly executed here

they quite clearly cross the line and when i mean they i mean bother the working class and the upper class you could easily argue that parasite refers to one family trying to suck another family dry or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class and expecting them to be grateful about it too there is also something about the american indian theme a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity nature is dog eat dog or is it a homage to an idyllic past where native american culture was relatively classless

either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles",4.5,2019-08-17,imdb
"this film doesnt allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects many ways to look at is it thriller comedy drama societal critique its all of it and therefore none of it all in all i was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated

the style is there i grant it cinematography is great acting is awkward at some points but its ok because of the partially comedylike nature of this film

but then there is a problem with story telling it builds up nicely toward the middle where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below and then it makes an unexpected turn its alright to make a surprise at the end id even say its good as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line a reveal must make sense once it is revealed this one didnt do the job convincingly for me we are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party

this film is just fine but no masterpiece in my opinion some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting others are so obscure to the point of being pointless great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum unfortunately this one is leaning to the pointlessness",3.0,2020-03-04,imdb

with the hype around this movie best in ten years i had unreasonable expectations this is a funny almost silly story with great acting and with a couple of twists that make it inventive its also filmed photographed with gorgeous care lots of gently moving camera a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually its an example of classic great moviemaking i thought the acting was especially sharp like the complex job the leading woman yeojeong jo had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea and the rest of the cast played types that didnt tumble into stereotypes the story was smart enough to give them room to be complex but this isnt a probing complex movie actually the content is in the improbable situation and how it leads almost in a chaplinlike building of absurdities to comic tension the cameraman kyungpyo hong deserves credit for sure because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenesracing down dingy steps a downpour in the slums and graceful geometry in the fabulous house director bong joon ho deserves the praise he is getting that said the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise its been getting there are more impressive movies out there in various ways even just this year there are movies that have movied me more or made me laugh more or were more inventive im not naming movies maybe since this movie manages all three its notable but ill keep my admiration in place enjoy it",4.0,2020-02-03,imdb

"this movie is not a masterpiece by any means and all the apparent hype its getting why is it because this is a foreign film trying to be an american film that is trying to be an american genre film

the good
the actors are good
some good cinematography definitely some cool scenes like the flooding late in the film
the twist near the middle of the film is a good twist however its like 50 minutes in and its too late the film is semiboring up to that point


the bad
weve all seen those lessthanstellar films where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another not the comedies where its supposed to be funny or dumb but the serious films and you sit there thinking man these criminals are effing morons its just not believable youve seen those right well this is one of those


i could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision even two but every single one its just not believable because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family but once theyre all in and making buck then they all become stupid doesnt work

the bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping and the criminals decide to hang out get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy familys living room even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a what if next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly really

then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure why wouldnt even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something oh sure one of them eventually does but like 30 minutes later when its too late

the film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes not halfway through the movie",2.5,2019-12-31,imdb

ive seen parasite three times in five days i think something may be wrong with me its just so good even after repeat viewings the hightension scenes still hold so many thrills bong joonho has made a perfect film ive seen it so many times ive memorized the characters lines so i can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles this made the movie even more enjoyable i just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie pretty much conversing with myself here but feel free to read oh and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you havent seen the movie

yeojeong jo the performer who plays mrs park is such a gem her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch her face is so expressive and bright there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious she is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultrarich park family

my favorite character is still mr kim played by regular bong hitter kangho song the way bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as hes said song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right this proved to be a real challenge for editor jinmo yang who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work for example song may have had an over the top take but jo may have had her best take of that same scene yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors its seamless to us but to yang thats a lot of pressure personally this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film i worked on good to know larger productions do this too",5.0,2019-11-12,imdb
"it isnt every day that you come across a movie like this a practically flawless one in my opinion actually i have nothing but praise for director bong joonho and i can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months this is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive dont worry this review wont have any spoilers whatsoever

to begin this praise train i have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor choi wooshik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movieanother standout would be kangho song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by bong joonho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities

a transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie the pacing was consistently on point where everything even the change in tone is seamless along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semibasement house in the suburbs

furthermore another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by jung jaeil which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone i shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie",5.0,2020-01-10,imdb

the kims are another family of four but for reasons we are not sure of live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city none of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever albeit in a machiavellian way for example they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly

the english tutor at the parks home recommends to the son of the kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns this soon snowballs into all members of the kim family shamelessly exploiting the park family and their employees their crimes are as follows

"i had to leave a comment because i have no idea how this movie received an 85 rating 6 range at best as far as korean masterpieces go i thought the handmaiden and the housemaid were far better stories about class the script had tremendous ideas and i was looking forward to them  and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot it felt very messy there were scenes that had no follow up or no point like they had to fill a plot hole last minute if hours of this film were cut that would make sense it felt like it couldnt decide if it wanted to be a dark drama or a dark comedy if it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy you went too far if you wanted to be a intense drama you really dropped the ball it felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe the more i think about it the less respect i seem to have for its artistic merrit absolutely overrated

as im reading throught the miles of reviews im convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year or theyre all paid the common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this another reviewer commented this is the same exact plot as married with children even down to chicago illinois being a factor just blew my mind and now i have even less respect for the script",3.0,2023-05-12,imdb
parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that its getting the script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place the actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in english really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere the whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audiences emotions and get them fully engage in watching i gave the film a 1010 because the way they made the film was smooth clean and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it,5.0,2020-01-24,imdb

"i expected a lot from parasite gisaengchung since it won the palme dor at the cannes film festival and because i really like bong joonhos previous films

still it exceeded my expectations its a comedy drama thriller and horror film in one sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained i think parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public

the cinematography and miseenscene are beautiful as it often is in korean films the style is very similar to burning by lee changdong but the story is something else during the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thrillerhorror im not going to say more about the plotstory than that because i dont want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything

bong joon hos tragicomedy that is a comedy without clowns and tragedy without villains ho 2019 is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite making sure to land both class realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting meticulous production design and breathtakingly purposeful cinematography although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes refreshingly the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child in this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two when the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child no such barrier is present and they are on the same side bong joon ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives i believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans,4.5,2020-01-31,imdb

"much like its creature name sake bong joonho s parasite is a movie that latches on to you and wont let go the story of parasite revolves around a poor family that cons a rich family into hiring them and once the poor family becomes integrated to the rich family the selfishness of the poor family starts to threaten everything multiple times in the film we are shown scenes of the humiliation abuse and the depravity of the poor family the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away the shots are there to tell a story and not used as gratuitous fillers for shock value

"ive often thought that the genre mix of comedy  thriller is the most difficult to bring off somehow the two different kinds of reality in their extremes dont mix easily unless the very nature of the narrative demands it as in dr strangelove

the comic first half is somewhat slow and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family by a streetwise poor one however when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge and so i couldnt believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified

a brave attempt but in the end i was left feeling a bit numb it all seemed to lack any solid centre with serious themes looking trivial and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining all a bit tasteless really",3.0,2020-02-29,imdb

parasite is the heartbreaking and mindshattering story of a poor south korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one through schemes intense plotting and brilliantly written twists disguising itself at first as a comedy layered with social criticism the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius with moments that will literally take your breath away bong joonho crafts a nearperfect movie with topnotch careful directing beautifully flawed and intense writing heartwrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals but in the end parasite isnt a comedy it isnt horror it isnt a thriller and it isnt a drama it is film and thats what is so painfully gorgeous about it 98  10,5.0,2019-11-21,imdb

parasite is a deep complex layered multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day south korea it is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the havents the havents are pitted against each other  it is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture from the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax director bong joon ho of memories of murder and the host fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against humans imperialistic pleasures  as a result what starts in a mild satirical tone climaxes in a disturbing manner so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of south korean urban class struggle this is no easy movie let me remind you but if you can finish the journey it can stay with you forever for the ample food for thought it offers truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace korean director predicting huge applause at the academy awards this year may be the holy grail of movie making as well a must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap dc comics genre,4.5,2020-02-09,imdb

as one other reviewer said all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie technically it is very well crafted great cinematography great acting but personally i think overhyped in a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor a little bit too stereotipically i might add is bound to get great reviews actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess and social justice folk of twitter feel they have been done justice even if only for two hours on a theater hollywood wants to be that white knight and last year it paraded in their red carpet mexican native yalitzia aparicio this year it was the korean actors ill bet next year it will be another troupé like the rich family in the movie minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to hollywood useful and good while they serve their purpose stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they dont no wonder 202 oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind i dont think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it beware though last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory,3.5,2020-02-13,imdb

"following the step of get out it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout no worries you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike mother  us

parasite welcomes the audience into multigenres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act pure comedy dark comedy to heavy dramas horror thriller mystery you name it the director bong joonho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation

with merely 10 characters into play parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film

parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values informationpacked dialogues lavish architecture production designs  vibrant colours

quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary if they can cut short and add new scenes instead the pacing will be better and more entertaining

majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements

i thought that there might be some symbolism of north koreasouth korea as well as social class but i havent seen anyone else point that out so it could be me grasping at straws

for the main family the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began minus the father and daughter kiwoo and chungsook are presumably still struggling at the bottom of the stairs again everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away thus describes bong joonhos ruthless realism the poor get poorer and life continues on with no plan to fix anything

the movie ended in hurry somehow not showing the life of kim kiwoo  i like that for the first time i see quality into this koreanchinesejapanese culture movies recorded 

this movie is pure fiction  but is not feeling like it couldnt become a real thingh  because doesnt look that unrealistic to happen

im sorry but i must be living on another planet  i cant understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10 i felt a little bored in parts and i felt uncomfortable reading some other reviews after the film maybe there were some aspects i hadnt analysed and worked out intellectually but then still i felt it was totally over hyped,2.5,2020-02-18,imdb
"the movie parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films people are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made after 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and dont even realise youre reading

anyway back to this movie parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama thriller romance and horror all in one unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99 of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain i wont give anything away but i will say that parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019",4.0,2020-01-12,imdb
parasite is a melody of fine cinema it hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring the cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other it also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing it excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling overall bong joonho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions the film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape,5.0,2020-01-24,imdb
with parasite director bong joonho creates an fantastic piece of cinema that never lost my attention once this movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new its fresh its clever its shocking and its satisfying there is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other around the middle point something is revealed to the audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there its an unrelenting roller coaster ride bong joonho also writes some fantastic characters each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine not one character seemed out of place or without reason they all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas the actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all,5.0,2020-01-22,imdb
"the working class and down on their luck kim family struggle to make ends meet when a friend of the son kiwoos who is an english tutor for the daughter in the wealthy park family has to leave his position he recommends kiwoo for the job now having an in with the wealthy family the kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household but not everything is as it seems in the park house or with their previous servants

this movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family the differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the welltodo having what usually gets termed as firstworldproblems while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood it doesnt shy away or try to be subtle about it but interestingly enough we dont feel beaten over the head with it either which is a major change from the hamfisted approach taken by most filmmakers couching this in a comedy is a good approach as well as the audiences guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas

however i do say its mostly a comedy the third act takes a dark dark turn and the contrast not to mention general disdain and even indifference between the classes becomes much more severe this gets into some hard territory and characters that weve found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves at the same time it doesnt feel unexpected almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it but arent surprised by it when it does show up this is some masterful characterization

another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor",5.0,2019-10-19,imdb
an instant classic its a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble somehow these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the top the performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film dialogue is very engaging and riveting it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all the story is well executed and well paced there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes the editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the films atmosphere of tension and ease the statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night overall it is one of the best films i have ever seen and it is one of the parasites i am happy to have in my life,5.0,2020-01-24,imdb
bong joonho is a filmmaker whose work ive admired since i saw snowpiercer 2013 ive had my eyes on him ever since and ill watch pretty much any film he directs his newest film parasite 2019 is not only the best film ive seen from him so far but it might also be the best film ive seen so far this year he may have crafted his own masterpiece this film is sharp its tight and hooks you till the very end its very fast paced its an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film the performances are all excellent across the board the script the dialogue and the writing are all brilliant and the score is very intense and enthralling and to top it all off this film is shot very well the cinematography and directing are great and the shot composition is very interesting and above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch i cant wait to see it again i cant praise this film enough in words see it as soon as you can i highly recommend it and it might be the best film ive seen so far this year,5.0,2019-09-14,imdb
"i think theres a really good movie buried in parasite somewhere but i gave up trying to find it it has the same problem the directors previous the host had the pacing is broken

thats not all though people have written about the movies unexpected twists and turns the thing is it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive they are too few and far between and too unbelievable the first major twist happens about an hour in and seems to come out of nowhere

the parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich parks are the best bits though they are far fetched how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand

but then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly until by the end i wasnt even paying attention

pity some of the sequences were brilliant",3.0,2019-12-20,imdb
"i have seen two films previously from the director of this film bong joon ho those being okja and the host i like them both quite a bit i think however that parasite is the best film i have seen from him dont judge this movie on the us trailers i felt they did a really bad job marketing the film they made it look really pretentious in reality the actual movie isnt anything like that trailer this is a dark funny insane crazy and thought provoking film

i wont get too much into the plot as i feel its something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family the kims who try and take advantage of a rich family the parks things get complicated from there

the acting in this movie is phenomenal everyone here gives their a game the directing by bong joon ho is simply masterful the screenplay is smart creative darkly funny like a coen bros movie it reminded me a lot of fargo especially and is pure insanity at points the film doesnt take sides on either family they both do pretty bad things but at the same time you surprisingly care about them despite how flawed both of them are the halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments i have seen all year the movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in korea

the cinematography is beautiful especially those big wide shots of environments the editing is exquisite no scene goes on for too long they make every second of this film matter and i never felt bored by the film the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me the music is also pretty good as well

overall parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year it has great performances amazing direction one of the best screenplays of the year and it keeps you guessing what will happen next go into this movie as blind as you can the less you know the better",5.0,2019-12-02,imdb
this film is either a love or hate review i get that most that hate it maybe didnt understand the message  i did but it was written in a mindboggling illogical plothole ridden way what makes it even worse is how great it was from the start that when the ridiculousness kicked in you become extremely disappointed there are so many ways this couldve been written much better  and still get the message across and maintain the initial theme without tanking directing and cinematography were excellent and the casting on point and the 132 min runtime was flying by until the plot started to tank clearly overhyped and not worth anything more than my 610,3.0,2020-01-27,imdb
"i think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deepermore groundbreaking than it actually is it has the plot of a romcom with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary wow class differences exist thanks bong joonho for enlightening me

just because youve successfully deciphered what the directorwriter sought to convey doesnt mean hes necessarily saying anything profound people need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film its significance remains painfully surfacelevel

i see a lot of people separating this movie into halvesand its fitting during the first half i was fairly interested and as i saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events i started wondering how the hell it had won best picture alongside the universal acclaim

well after the former housekeepers return the stupidity that ensues yesthat moment and the very end inclusive signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise however its here where the film starts to break down for me

we accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening thats ok for some time for some genres but i simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy the existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to and on top of it i genuinely dont care what happens to any of these people save a tinge of regret for mr parks taking a knife to the chest i find it impossible that the tutorson could survive two 2 skullcrushing throws of a rock to the head and i genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than mr",1.5,2020-07-29,imdb
i know a lot of people have skipped this because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours i hope you are reading this and i hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations please watch this movies like this are very rarely made nowadays doesnt matter what genre a person likesthis has it all comedy love family thriller crime horror what an awesome movie ,5.0,2020-01-19,imdb
you will watch it and you know it has subtleties it talks about how poor and rich nice people see each other it doesnt bore you for a single minute it is the best this year,5.0,2019-10-11,imdb
"i read a lot of rave reviews about this before i saw it i also saw it on many must see lists the past month so i thought alright ill watch it and approached it with a show me what you got kind of attitude it didnt take long before i realized that i was watching something incredibly different in fact it is incomparable with anything ive ever seen before it belongs and at the same time doesnt fit in in any kind of genre it is as thrilling as the best parts of gone girl and is everything jordan peeles us tried to be i would say that this is the most divine work of cinema ive seen in many many years

some people refrain from watching foreign language films i find myself paying more attention to the plot since i have to read what is being said this is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment which this one does

parasite deserves a 1010 because of the very simple reason that i wouldnt want to change a single second of it everything had purpose so watch it i bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews",5.0,2020-01-02,imdb
oh man so i love this movie beautifully shot and exquisitely acted parasite is funny tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like i like my films the director bong joonho has delivered yet again im in on everything thing else he makes go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it definitely watch it when its streaming you wont be disappointed parasite is a 10,5.0,2019-11-02,imdb
"i spent some time with the movie parasite tonight it captured me in its symbiotic web im sure there is not a single adjective that could describe it adequatelyso i wont attempt that magficent accomplishment parasite tugged on every ounce of my acquired knowledge in philosophy literature and korean yesi do have a very tiny bit of that   the set design was amazingand it may give 1917 a run for its money

the stairsoh so thoroughly magnificent in the simplicity yet the most complex of metaphors yeah i made myself giggle on that one i was instantly reminiscent of my philosophy 101 allegory of the cavei went down thank you herr hanak

okay ive lost all of you i loved this movie for the best foreign filmmostly because my theater neighbors tonight ate every kind of snack bar food possiblei will have nightmares about the gnawing they chatted and checked their phones throughoutthen they pottied and were able to read the screenand then they seemed confused wonder why

my feeling about awardsknowing the methodolgy of the votingthis film will not be best picture on oscar night",5.0,2020-01-22,imdb
for me parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern so that its hard to tell which genre you just saw the script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end moreover the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movies shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters which are all put on with a lot of love,4.5,2020-01-22,imdb
i dont really understand the high rate for the movie it is very normal expected movie,3.0,2020-01-02,imdb
"i will just say this first if you are planning to watch this film stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms

now directed by joonho bong who also directed memories of murder and snowpiercer parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre its really hard to describe this film i would compare this with quentin taratino films like the title suggests but even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice that aside joonho bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling so much so that at first viewing you wont notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents the name parasite is just one of them at the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are is it the rich the poor their expendable need for a better living or the house itself acting wise i dint see a single false note by any actors the main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by kangho song writing is however what makes this film so great you can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything there is not a single loop hole every character choices make sense everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point

there is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it the social structure with the way we live our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently our priorities and what we value joonho bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened he has completely turned a genre on its head a film about social class has never been made like this before",5.0,2019-09-18,imdb
this is the best korean film of all time now that is not really saying much as korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with chinese japanese and indian films in asia but if this film is any indication korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in asia this black comedy has the feel of coen brothers special though not quite as pithy or broad there is more character development here than in most coen films with the exception of fargo joonho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws each actor in the film does a very nice job with the daughter of the hustler family i love good hustler films doing an outstanding turn i look forward to joonhos next project,3.5,2020-01-31,imdb
after a first screening in a theatre i couldnt understand the hype around parasite so i watched it a second time at home and once again wasnt impressed at all i suppose its just not my kind of flick and as i write this review a few months later i realize that i dont remember much of it even after seeing it twice i have read all the praising comments with a 1010 note but couldnt find any of the qualities described as if people commented another movie,2.0,2020-04-04,imdb
what a great movie no words for very long moments i was so immersed that i forgot i was watching a movie the plot is greatly crafted it always moves forward and escalates when the story requires it the tension is remarkable i think the fathers reason to kill mr park couldve been established a little clearer but anyway the movie is great,4.0,2020-01-22,imdb
such a precise way of unfolding a story every frame is captivating tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you cant take your eyes off any single character altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until its inevitable and explosive third act im in awe of this film,5.0,2020-01-03,imdb
one of the best movies of all time i would say its genre bending ranging from funny suspenseful thrilling to emotional,5.0,2019-10-28,imdb
i might say the titel and the cover seems a bit decieving it looks more like something for a horror movie but it totally isnt a horror movie this film just keeps you wondering what will happen and shows a great contrast between the poor and rich however wrong the path that main character chose it was really creative the plot twist were also very well done and how every part of the movie seemed to fit with each other,5.0,2019-09-22,imdb
one thing i always want from a movie is great start and building characters with fun this movie perfectly delivers that while watching you feel like yes those peoples are really poor look how they are chasing for a free wifi signal movie is fast paced and i quite liked the ending surely one of the best movie of this decade,5.0,2019-08-24,imdb

was expecting a great movie about social inequality i find i usually agree with the imdb rating but this movie was not about social inequality or class status it is about a down on their luck con artist family completely understandable the boy lying about going to university to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for but morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears but then the family lies manipulates and scams two people to get fired deplorable do people do this cause they are poor no its cause they are criminals there are criminals at all social levels so this is not some type of movie about social inequality how disappointing but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers but true to form the scam is threatened to unravel,3.0,2020-02-24,imdb
maybe people get too emotional in west may be that is why it got an oscar theres nothing special about this movie the story so average,1.0,2020-04-03,imdb
"a question in my mind after watching this movie is if im one of these roles and what will i do

parasite presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet the depiction of bottomclass people in this film are both sympathized but greedy although rich people are kind they just cant stand the smell and life quality from bottomclass people and they express their emotion too obviously to bottomclass people this is humanity and there is no correct answer but we can think deeply in this issue and what if you are neither parasite nor host would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing

its very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film",5.0,2019-09-17,imdb
"this movie is just smart entertaining and artistically fulfilling if it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects this would be a very good movie but instead it just excels at all three

the script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining and the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely it is just beautiful

it is difficult to judge the acting when you dont speak the language but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world yet so similar to ours

i just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone whos reading to watch this movie i really enjoyed it and i will gladly watch it again some time in the future",5.0,2019-12-07,imdb
a must see if you are tired of endless hollywood sequels and super hero movies a cant miss if you are into quentin tarantino type of movies although without a heroic central character this is a very entertaining story thats beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns at a nice and tight pace from start to finish,5.0,2019-10-27,imdb
went in with little knowledge about this movie this movie was hilarious suspenseful and horrifying i left the theater with a huge smile on my face even if you dont watch foreign films this should be your exception because this film is something special,5.0,2019-11-19,imdb
as i write this i want to describe my raw initial state after i finished the film im in a state of complete awe staring into the wall kind of awe parasite is truly a work of art a sheer masterpiece this film oozes with mastery every little detail tells a story of its own i was drawn to it like a moth to a flame it grips hard and it never lets go it sways between genres gracefully it offers comedy both dark and light drama horror thrill and its all packaged so seamlessly conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board ive watched my share of korean cinema to know thats a common thing but parasite takes it to a whole other level it materializes thoughts and ideas things words can not communicate it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film i can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way just incredible director bong joon ho proves that he is a master within his own crossgenre domain he takes charge and you actually feel like youre in safe hands watching this he shapes the scenes perfectly a true master of his trade thank you in all honesty i feel like i went through an experiment where the time went still and i experienced a piece of art such as this i absloutely wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film mindblowing,5.0,2019-11-26,imdb
best film ive seen in a long while great plot good twist highly recommended,5.0,2019-12-30,imdb
"parasite became the first foreign language film to win the best picture oscar the first third of the film had me wondering why

the film opens in a dilapidated smelly semi basement in south korea the kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbours wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected they make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes

dad kitaek is the weak link he cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted son kiwoo gets a stroke of fortune when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma kiwoo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy park family who live in a lavish mansion soon kiwoo gets his sister kijung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son

the wily kijung conspires to get the parks family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother chungsook

all of them claim to be strangers to the park family pretty soon the kims are earning good money and living well they are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy parks

their good fortune is threatened when one night when the parks are away on a break the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind

i thought the movie would turn out to be similar to joseph loseys the servant which was scripted by harold pinter it goes in that direction but then swerves off

when bong joon ho accepted his best director oscar he publicly thanked martin scorsese it was his movies bong studied in film school the key is scorseses own british influences ranging from ealing films hitchcock to powell  pressburger

there is a parasite in the park household but the film is about class a fatalistic metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy",3.5,2020-02-24,imdb
so happy i managed to see this movie with no idea what was to come though the trailers were a strong indication of what was to come i wish i didnt have to rely on subtitles knowing there are many subtleties you miss with limited translation ater some time for reflection this movie reminds me of shoplifters another excellent movie that reflects on unconventional familial love,4.0,2020-01-24,imdb
"the only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie and let me be clear here not just specifically korean but literally any nonus movie on par with parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as parasite anyway with a bit of luck of course actually not just a bit of luck they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because thats what happened with parasite it is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought thats a lot better than what i expected domino effect followed and today we got this movie thats overrated and predictable no different than your average thriller movie

p s the only reason i went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm the movie is still watchable when drunk",3.0,2021-07-23,imdb
"a story there was thrilling scenes there were some pretty cinematography yes solid character buildup hell no logical plot no entertainment not much consistency of characters missing petty resentful ignorance towards the rich yes narrow and shallow depiction of the poor very much

so not convincing every stretch of the movie i thought i started understanding the characters a bit more but no next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again in the end it made me fail to attach with any of the characters

without enough entertainment what were the film makers trying to tell the audience i completely dont get it

really doesnt match the hype wasted two hours of my life",2.5,2020-01-04,imdb

disclaimer this review is in two parts part one will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers part two will delve deeper into the film itself so read part 2 only if youre cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film with that out of the way

part one

parasite is no misnomer it fully lives up to its title as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities i cant go a few minutes without remembering of some image joke line or scene from the film my selfdiagnosis is apt and i fear i may be terminal

i think the best way to go into this film is to go how i went totally blind ive been looking forward to parasite well before it took the palme dor at canne this year bong joonho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece a devilishly wild pitchblack comedy very much domesticated and between two families ill leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story just know this film is in korean so it is subtitled it loses nothing in translation but i really wish i knew how to speak korean so i could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue

the story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper like quicksand before too long youre in too deep the editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by it feels modern sleek and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad

its worth traveling to see with joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities",5.0,2019-11-11,imdb

an incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease schizophrenia there is a legendreality myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water rarely documented as hard scientific fact it actually fits in quite well with the masterful presentation of parasite throughout the movie one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism that things dont quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do with the help of a young man imho that has has all the tell take signs of the disease overrinflated worth that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance of upper class bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of south korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the english language through delusion validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from princeton university verifying his talents similarly his mother as the rest of the family enslaved in making a living through folding pizza boxes in his fantasy each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class in reality would never happen and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member what could be better,4.5,2020-01-15,imdb
this sort of reminds me of a mix between comedy and drama i understand that parts were meant to be funny and because of the difference in culture and sub titles lots of the humor was lost on me but i could tell that some parts were meant to be funny it was all very interesting and kept me wondering what was going to happen next i thought this was a horror movie and it is not at all more of a tradegy and social commentary the smell didnt register with me either untill nearly the end but it was a great plot device,4.5,2020-01-18,imdb
the hype surrounding this film is too much hearing people rave about it calling it a masterpiece movie of the year even film of the decade with all that praise i expected it to be on par with films in terms of storytelling acting script etc like the godfather pulp fiction the shawshank redemption or park chanwooks oldboy but no it didnt even came close but still it was a very entertaining movie people only overrate it,3.0,2019-12-01,imdb
like the title the film is catchy and dramatic to the end,4.5,2020-01-18,imdb
"parasite is a highly polished and prettylooking movie but it falls short in a few ways my biggest issue was that i couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities and the rich family are basically clueless airheads i really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story the movie also suffered from a severe case of tonal whiplash meaning the tone was all over the place sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously like a straight drama

also in the last quarter the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose this wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised

the movie also has some glaring plot holes like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home i guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film",3.5,2020-05-13,imdb

nowadays the horror movies seem to be just about blood gores and fearinducing trite parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of hollywood the synopsis wont be needed as you need to see it for yourself and for your own good the fact that hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity,4.0,2020-01-18,imdb
it was between an 8 or 9 for me and the super originality and unique story was why i gave it a 9 the only con i had was it was a pretty creepy movie throughout and i had an ending playing out in my head that i thought was going to happen and thought it would be great i was way off course which is also a great pro at the same time,4.5,2020-01-17,imdb
"oh my goodness this is one of the best films ive seen in a while if you choose to see this film i plead for you to go in blind thats the best way to view it

"i generally never watch foreign language movies because im annoyed by the subtitles but this movie hooks you up to the screen with its visuals the acting the premise the shifts in the tone you never know whats going to happen next i dont understand korean but still i could connect and realte to the characters after watching joker i wasnt expecting any other film this year to even come near it but this came out like an underdog both are 10 on 10 for me i wish such movies are made more i hope it gets a dub so that more people could watch it if they are not into foreign films this is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like fargo or even breaking bad it has a similar aura to it

i literally dont have any major critic for the film but if i have to nitpick i wish the death of kims son was real because when it was implied at the beginning that hes dead but the later on revealed that he survived takes away the horror of that scene

overall its dark funny horror and sometimes feels like its real what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just dont know it how many mask they wear",5.0,2019-11-04,imdb

"i tried to watch this movie once and faded out after the first ten minutes its surprising too as the first scenes with the slacker family were very very funny and entertaining it reminded me of the beginning of old boy in a way upon my second viewing i was stunned fully engrossed and entertained all the way through this is perhaps the best film of the year i havent seen little women or 1917 yet

the story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees the rich family doesnt know they are related the poor family discover a man living in the basement who happens to be the former maids husband violence ensues and the movie just becomes more detailed fun thrilling and entertaining all the way through

usually movies tend to drop out near the end or close to the climax i find i usually get bored at this point this film doesnt do that it almost reminds me of fight club with its dark humor and thrills in fact thats the only movie that comes to mind though they are very different films parasite does have its own take on class which is very prevalent it seems the rich and poor are very similar with the middle class not even being presented in the movie

overall this is a tremendous movie im glad i gave it a second chance probably the best movie of the year

review this film is truly an original masterpiece from bong joon hos direction to all of the phenomenal acting so intricate and precise it left a really special film positives as i mentioned the directing is absolutely superb bong joon ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film you feel as though your living through what the characters are living through the acting is oscar worthy all around kangho song sunkyun lee yeojeong jo woosik choi sodam park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together the big stand outs to me were definitely kangho and yeojeong i feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing whether it was the build up for kim kitaek kangho song to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of park yeonkyo yeojeong jo you really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance negatives its tough for me to come up with any negatives this is one of those films where i dont see very much wrong at all however its a film i couldnt see myself rewatching more than twice not that its a bad film or too heavy subject matter its just not one of those films i gravitate towards for multiple viewings and thats why i dont have it as a perfect 1010 conclusion this is one of those films i definitely encourage everyone to see at least once its so original and so well told that i know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema it will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film",4.0,2020-02-10,imdb

overrated doesnt even begin to describe this film im a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced and so it was with this film sadly it does not deliver like his other works do performances are all uniformly excellent  particularly that of the poor familys father and the house maid of the rich family inventive camera work a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and thenthe story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover as the film crawled towards its conclusion i couldnt wait to get out of the theater by the time its hoping to be ending arrives i had already checked out an interesting failure with a lot on its mind but in the end whats really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isnt truly made i would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place this is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get i keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer paraphrasing a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different  yeah becomes a big stinker,2.5,2019-10-30,imdb

"parasite is bong joonho at his best i was at first sceptical when i was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten i was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and i would come out of the film disappointed i couldnt have been more wrong parasite is fantastic it nails a lot of technical aspects such as cinematographyediting and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year these technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by bong joonho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next it covers comedy drama horrorthriller and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems the way it does all of this is so subtle it doesnt go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes it shows us which i think is a lot more powerful it doesnt villanize any one class both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic the acting is also really strong i cant put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort

on the negative end however some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film specifically the birthday party sequence i just didnt agree that this would be something the character would do i still found the actions performed to be entertaining i just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well

overall parasite is a very well directed written and acted film which is enhanced even further by its excellent cinematography production design and editing with great performances from an excellent ensemble parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its oscar praise",5.0,2020-02-03,imdb

"parasite was one of the contenders for best picture that i was intrigued by i had only heard good things going in but nothing of the actual plot points i came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred nothing had prepared me for what i just endured parasite is truly a different film with semirealistic events think of it as the very absentminded ibsen for film every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm although it gets gruesome towards the finish line parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class

the film opens to the kim family a very lowclass family living in a semibasement in south korea the family consists of kitaek the father chungsook the mother kiwoo the son and kijeong the daughter they all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middleclass lifestyle the house struggles with animal infestation as kitaek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house acting as a bug disenfectant minhyk kiwoos friend offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house a stone which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it

on his final night in town before studying abroad minhyk offers kiwoo his job as an english tutor for the wealthy park family kiwoo declines due to his lack of degrees but minhyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from kijeong who excels with her photoshop kiwoo enters the parks house where the interview is to be held yeongyo the mother of the park family trusts him fully as he becomes an english tutor for dahye the eldest child on his way out he notices a painting by the youngest child dasong kiwoo under the alias kevin from mrs park refers his cousin from illinois named jessica who is actually kijeong kijeong and mrs",5.0,2020-02-05,imdb
"parasite a parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body and parasites are not good for the host body what if two parasite organisms come together in one host body this is what the bong joon ho put forward to us the main theme of film is characteristics of human beings changing their circumstances

reality is that after all more than half the species on earth are parasites and most organisms are host to a number of them

kim ki taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family membersthe only family income is proceeds from pizza cover makingone evening at dinner a friend of kim kiwoos kim kiwoo is ki taeks son came to visit kiwoo and he gifted his grandfathers a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to kiwoo kiwoo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job and then he starts teaching mr and mrs parks daughter in their home permanently da hye fall in love with ki woo

mrs parks son da  song he is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing kiwoo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist but really shes not one of these and she also enters the house

kim ki  taek tells his family rich people are realy gullible the two kims plan to dismantle mr parks driver and appoint their father as the driver and then the entire kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper kims wife comes to the house of the parks housekeeper and they all continue to work it is here that the name of the film becomes a make sense

kims family life goes well in that house one day mr parks family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his sons birthday kims family gathers at mr parks house that night unbeknownst to park suddenly the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course that night everyone in the house changes their lives",4.0,2020-01-30,imdb

the movie is just okish it has some memorable moments but it does not get you hooked to it all the time actually some parts are quite boring and you can get distracted easily

i dont really understand how it go so much success and won the oscar the direction is ok i cannot say the opposite but performances no way some of them near a series b movie performance more than a movie that had won some oscars

the first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed it could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family but the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half it lost me

it lost me even more that its hailed as a masterpiece for oscar its plain to see that oscars have a political or some kind of agenda i mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in oscars",3.0,2021-07-16,imdb
"we live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good

however the moral from hans christian andersens story the emperors new clothes is telling ourselves something is good doesnt mean it is and that is very much the case for parasite

in the main the film isnt too bad a poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy the acting is only alright but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say and the viewer doesnt learn much about the wealthy family the film also leaves many unanswered questions such as
what happened to kiwoos friend who went abroad and what did he make of it all at the end
why did kiwoos father do what he did at the end
what was the point of the love interest between dahye and kiwoo
its all a little silly really

the film will appeal to
supposed film critics ie the type who claim certain wines go with certain foods who more often than not follow the norm of other film critics
the eccentric

this is the first time i can remember that a koreanlanguage film has been nominated for the best picture oscar and it is also nominated for academy awards in the international feature former foreign language film original screenplay production design editing and director bong joon ho categories as well it is already the first korean film to win the palme dor at the cannes film festival this movie was funnier than i was expecting set in seoul it shows a poor family the kims ingratiating themselves with a rich one the parks the members of the rich family are actually quite decent although somewhat condescending and gullible and the kims are likable rogues the kims consisting of a father mother son and daughter live in a semibasement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate the father and mother are unemployed the son kiwoo choi wooshik has failed the entrance exam for the south korean university system and the daughter kijung park sodan has failed to get into an art school they fold pizza boxes for cash when a friend park seo joon tells kiwoo that the park teenage daughter dahye jung jiso needs a tutor kiwoo applies for and with the help of documents forged by his sister gets the job then when he learns that the park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event kiwoo recommends his sister without disclosing that that she is his sister the traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later with the help of google she bluffs her way into obtaining the position then kijung figures out how to get the park family chauffeur fired and the kim father kitaek song kangho gets the job using the cookhousekeepers lee jung eun peach allergy they manage to get her fired as well and the kim mother chungsook jang hyejin takes her place,4.5,2020-02-03,imdb
"parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively but this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating if you like movies with social commentary this one is for you it is so good with pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year

it is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story to see the father of the family on the same scene  trying to save everything he has from his flooded house while on the next scene he has to pretend that everything is fine

so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them

"i wont go into the details of the plot which can be read elsewhere but simply give me impressions well directed interesting story even if there were some clunky moments good acting good dialogue but way too long

people are raving about parasite im not one of them masterpiece hardly all the characters are supremely unlikable perhaps that was intentional ironically the rich family provoked more sympathy which i doubt was intentional i racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie do you suppose bc it has a sub text i mean of course it has a sub text it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in korea but that is plainly obvious its not subtle actually its not even a sub text it is the text but up against hollywood cinema which rarely has any sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large parasite then is seen as sophisticated

i didnt rate parasite very highly thats my loss i guess",3.0,2020-02-18,imdb
"parasite is in my opinion a very korean movie what do i mean with that well i will get into that late but firstly it was directed by bong joonho who is best known for his english language movies snowpiercer and okja both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple they at least try to have an atmosphere they also have a clear message which however show a very naïve perspective on reality even his previous korean language movies like mother and the host are very similar in that fashion parasite however doesnt really show much of that regard neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the korean movies i have seen with the exception of the masterpieces burning and april snow parasite however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the bong movies but thats the only thing good about the movie however maybe besides the production value the movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it it is lacking in many other departments however the characters for example are terribly written they are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring because of its focus on the characters the soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes which shows that the production value wasnt well spend in all places the acting is decent considering the director nothing bad but also nothing extraordinary the story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing

so overall i would say this movie was pretty mediocre thats why i said its pretty korean",2.5,2019-12-01,imdb
"parasite is a south korean family dramablack comedy with some great acting and a unique premise it doesnt take long to establish the characters but does well to give us time to get to know them its essentially the tale of two families the kims  dad kitaek kang ho mum hyae jin son kiwoo woo shik  daughter kijung so dam and the parks  dad dongik sun kyun mum yeonkyo yeo jeong son dasong jung  daughter dahye ziso

the kims are poor living in the slums when kiwoo gets a job tutoring dahye at the parks nice house on the other side of seoul even though theres symmetry in the parentssondaughter this isnt an us scenario but rather an exploration of class social status and unconscious biases theres no good guys or bad guys  just a semirealistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there

all of the actors are great with a nice mix of fun and humour with seriousness and desperation the twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions  theres a few different ways it couldve played out not quite a onelocation film but the house does serve as an extra character good score and cinematography the ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet devastating and hopeful",4.0,2020-02-01,imdb

"the dark satirical thriller directed by bong joonho began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word metaphor for countless amount of time and as youd usually expect from a bong film the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name  parasite  suggests though it depends on how you take it  what youd like to call it because stairway remains as another option as well how thats the beauty of this two hour long flick why lets discuss

and to begin with theres the plot that on paper didnt particularly make a lot of sense as its expected from a satire in general but the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty giving the film a base to build upon no matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth each and every actors in their respective roles probably have outdone themselves in that regard

on a technical note the cinematography in particular deserves a lot of credits hong kyungpyo managed to capture the essence of two types of korea something which was extremely important for the film in itself while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable the entire setup of the film that provided the innocence and realistic touch deserves a lot of extolling at the end the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together supervised by cj productions and of course bong with a tight budget itd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed ive been by their mindblowing piece of work

but everything aside what packs the ultimate punch the theme of differences of classes and how its showcased through the stairways",5.0,2020-01-29,imdb

the inciting incident involves kiwoos friend minhyuk who informs his buddy that hes going abroad and hell gladly give kiwoo his job as tutor to dahye the daughter in the wealthy park family whose father is ceo for an extremely successful tech company provided that he can convince the parks to take him on

the fun begins when kiyoo cons mrs park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software kiyoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager dahye and then convinces mrs park to hire his sister kijeong as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son dasong

i am not korean and maybe i cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me in some scenes i saw an actor or actress pretty weak in the next rather strong sometimes i had the feeling they were no professional actors at all and i can judge acting and i know that that was not on purpose the camera work was good i really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes some misleading others very clear would the storyline have been as thorough as that this would be a great movie in my opinion but it wasnt none of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments the dichotomy of a society here in lower class people and the rich worked well yet a little stereotypical the poor were poor but witty the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down no it wouldnt thats what this film tells us its a satire of course for a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a wellthought script like some others here i dont know why this got an oscar for best movie was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win,2.5,2020-06-21,imdb
"despite being incredibly edited and filmed beautiful dark cinematography this movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for the surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop with a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest

starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated

i didnt fall for the hype the acting and visuals would be close to 910 they definitely made the movie however the application of the story let it down a lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable for example it is believable very rare but has happened that someone could hide in a secret area but definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable but stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world how many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and dont stab people and a lot of scenes were bordering on slapstick with out comedy,3.0,2019-12-09,imdb

its good but not top 50 good

i feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something coolexotic

ask yourself how this film would have been received if set in us or uk and in english  i feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy  farce

definitely worth seeing dont let the hype set your expectations too high and youll enjoy it for what it is",3.5,2021-02-06,imdb
great work from start to end it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time the narrative and the actors were excellent one of the better endings of a movie the most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019,5.0,2020-01-13,imdb
"see while the film is moderately entertaining it is flawed it certainly isnt a masterpiece in any regard

the massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film because the kims are poor we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy the parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy the driver is underdeveloped the housekeeper we feel bad for at first but she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else

so the kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work all the energy and ambition they put into their scheme they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service but their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end are the park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving no is the house any cleaner the chauffeuring all that lifetransforming naw perhaps if the kims presence in the park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax

and the wealth rock symbolism got it if they were so smart they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment so yay never hold your metaphor  as the writing rule goes

and the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient for the kims its one dead two on probation and one scotfree after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide  only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class that is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind yeah yeah the dad gets trapped under the house how was this proper retribution he was never the mastermind his rotten kids were and mainly it was the son who is the agent of everything",3.0,2020-04-12,imdb
"this had the makings of a fun farce as i watched the first hour or so i thought it could be a madcap hollywood comedy implausible yes but amusing in an absurd way

but then it started to go in weird places some will call it social satire but to me it was just dark amoral and incoherent

the protagonists the family of scammers are profoundly unsympathetic they wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers yet the filmmaker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film

their story also makes no sense when we meet them they are solvenly helpless inept and unemployed in the opening scenes they are scolded for doing a simple job badlyassembling pizza boxes but then suddenly they become master con artists taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family running everything with efficiency and aplomb this is just bad writing not a masterpiece

while their employers were absurdly naive i didnt hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to yes they are silly but they are also hardworking and accomplished they love their kids and in almost every way they are morally superior to the people preying upon them in the directors upsidedown world view their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them the fates of the employers and their original employees dont seem consistent with any sort of moral compass

without spoilers all i can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters previous behavior if the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay unadorned with acting and cinematography it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess",0.5,2019-08-30,imdb
im just wowed by the film its an entertaining arthouse film that let audiences experience a variety of kinds of emotions during its screening this satirical dark thriller talks about a sensitive issue about our society faced with inequality of wealth and class warfare through a poor family infiltrating into a rich household in the manner of what the audiences can easily get the point not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowdpleaser actually this film cant be referred as a specific genre in terms of its narrative and the plot that contain the elements of comedy thriller and drama with the twists and turns bong again proves that he creates his own genre himself as just seen by many critics and cinephiles,5.0,2020-01-11,imdb
yup ive been watching bongjoonhos movie and this is an end result i wont say more this is a masterpiece,5.0,2020-01-12,imdb
"there i said itits the best film of the year for this reviewer and its the best film bong jongho has made to date

but to be fair ive yet to see the irishman 1917 and a hidden life so my opinion could change though i cant see that being likely

the originalness of parasite is what sets it apart parasite twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone theres ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor

class inequality is a theme director bong joonho frequently uses you observe it in his other films snowpiercer okja and even in the first film i ever saw of his back in 2006 with joonhos horror film the host which also starred kangho song who plays kevins father in parasite hes hilariously witty in both films

parasite set in south korea is about a young man from an impoverished family the kims who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family the parks he changes his name from kim kiwoo to kevin to impersonate an english tutor he soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the parks and the family makes it their plan to doso

the film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families when we see the wealthy park family the house is pristinely clean a complete contrast to the kim family apartment which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city

if you like dark comedies then youre sure to enjoy parasite ive witnessed people who dont like foreign films because of subtitlehatred still relish this film

you wont see another movie like parasite perhaps ever well done bong joonho",4.5,2020-01-12,imdb
i find the films visual symphonic the use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed the concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience bong joonho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of the film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions,5.0,2020-01-24,imdb

"whats funny is that the parasites in hollywood loved this film because they actually sided with the scumbag poor family

when the point of the film is that they get biblically punished by a flood for acting like demons that scene where shes smoking a cigarette on the toilet is powerful

although much like hitchcock taking it one twist too far at the very end of vertigo the poor dad killing the rich dad at the end felt totally undeserved it wasnt built up to properly it felt like the director just wanted to get to that point but the pieces werent placed to justify it for the audience or the character

if your daughter just got murdered by a fellow poor person why would your immediate reaction be to empathize with the plight of the daughter killer as inspiration for killing the rich guy completely out of left field sure the rich guy called him smelly and sure he was resentful towards him but to murder him in front of everyone just read as extremely false and dumb

i dont believe actual poor people would even like or empathize with this ending this is purely a trashy parasitical rich persons fantasy

its a shame the ending was so stupid because up until then it was a pretty darn good flick",3.0,2021-01-14,imdb

"the kims are a struggling lower class family one day the son gets an opportunity from a friend he also gets some goodluck rock from him that will lay a role later in the film he can work as an english tutor for a rich family his sister forges a bunch of documents for him so he appears us educated he gets the job and starts a relationship with the his tutee the rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect the wife is naive and lives in materialism the father a famous arrogant musician isnt home much but there he is worshiped they also have a young son who is trouble as all kids that age but the mother acts overwhelmed and thinks hes some kind of painter prodigy that gives the tutor a chance to get his sister hired as an art therapist for the troubled son so the sister impersonates an art therapist when shes meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead

now they all figure out a way to get rid of the housekeeper they succeed when the parks leave for a weekend the kims celebrate in the mansion then the former housekeeper shows up she reveals that there is a secret basement where shes been keeping her husband and begs mother kim to take care of him in exchange for money then the entire kim family falls literally to the ground in front of the housekeeper and this the entire scam is revealed to her she takes some video the families fight over the video then mother park calls announcing that they will return home soon the kims hide under the living room table the old housekeeper fell down the basement stairs and is seriously injured her husband is bound back in his basement room

eventually the kims escape as the parks actually decide to sleep in the living room theres heavy rain and their humble basement home has been flooded then they get a call from the parks to help them for a birthday party for the son next day",3.0,2020-09-13,imdb

this is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and i think the best work of bong joon ho yet its a very funny and playful movie you cant pin it down into one specific genre much like bong joon hos other work some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense the premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life one day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an english tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family the poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously what is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life the director shows the irony of life how two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently while watching the movie it was so engaging that i felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot,4.5,2020-01-12,imdb

apart from the great cinematography what overwhelmed me about this movie is its screenplay the movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact the dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime a movie for all genre lovers,4.5,2020-01-17,imdb
"parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force a film that transcends genres and defies easy categorization bong joonhos directorial brilliance is on full display in this korean masterpiece a compelling and thoughtprovoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor suspense and social commentary

from the opening scenes it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling the cinematography by hong kyungpyo is nothing short of breathtaking capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the kim family and the opulent luxury of the park residence each frame is a visual feast contributing to the films immersive experience

the narrative unfolds with a gripping precision as the kim family struggling in the lower echelons of society cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy park family the plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum keeping the audience on the edge of their seats bong joonhos screenplay is a work of art seamlessly blending elements of comedy drama and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story

central to the films success are the stellar performances from the cast song kangho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch kim kitaek navigating the complexities of his character with finesse the entire ensemble including choi wooshik park sodam and lee sunkyun deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles creating a palpable onscreen chemistry

the movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller its a profound commentary on societal inequality bong joonho skillfully uses the kim familys strategic infiltration of the park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the havenots the film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty",3.5,2023-11-09,imdb
director bong joonhos global sensation parasite is an allegorical tale of class warfare before watching the film i was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot if possible id recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can while parasite deals with heavy themes economic mobility climate change it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising a unique blend of drama suspense comedy and horror parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language,4.5,2020-02-09,imdb
this film is an ok film it has some funny moments some agony moments and a little drama i cant say i had a hard time watching it but i really cant understand how people lost their minds the poor family with all these lies get a very nice job with good money yet they still dont move out from the basement they decide to continue living in there and not moving out to start living a better life they even throw a party to the mansion and thinking how they can take more from the rich so am i supposed to feel sorry for them at the end the movie doesnt imply that the rich family are greedy or they stole money from others for themselves mr park seem to working pretty hard to be in that position and to earn his money they pay well the working staff and even extra is some occasions of course they seem to be discussed by the poor but they dont offend them in any way throughout the film so to me they are more likeable than the poor family overall is a good movie but thats it i literally dont understand the hype,3.0,2022-01-02,imdb
im really amazed under which category this film lies comedy it is not funny at all tragedy  i dont know four oscars and palm dor  are you serious i cant say that i know better than the people who awarded the film these prizes im sure the problem is me there is something hidden deep in this movie i couldnt see,1.5,2020-06-22,imdb
"in our current era of film it is commonplace to take a moral stance whether that stance is on human struggles political processes or social conditioning the stance prevails and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us films like elysium little women 1917 these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve

parasite does it differently the film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you so that you dont have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it you think you know who to root for and who is the bad guy

as you keep watching parasite continually pushes your sense of morals prodding you with the question how far is too far and how bad is too bad these questions never give you a break never give you time to come to terms with your answer as bong joon ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in its tracks

parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care",5.0,2020-01-13,imdb

"as many other reviewers have mentioned parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing there are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the endtake for example crossing the line  the rich dad keeps bringing it up he wants his staff to know their place that family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes

sure it was easy yet deceiving to infiltrate their household so cunningly but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upperclass folks they were serving even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesnt fit in despite the daughters fondness for him she might even be in love with him or shes just infatuated

the basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches the upperclass family lives in an incredible house high up in what i presume is seoul when their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all

the party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair the poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around in fact the very man he drives around is disgusted by him

"a family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of the inhabitants of the house on the other hand are so incredibly stupid that they dont notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell but the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell a bloodbath follows the end standing ovation at cannes palme dor 86star rating on imdb its not just a bad story no its actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor you cannot be expected to be good and if you are rich you are never good enough naturally stereotypical characters follow and i couldnt make myself care about any of them the only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it otherwise all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end now i know im supposed to dislike the rich family but although i didnt like them either i dont see whats so wrong about them but the urge in society to favor the havenots no matter what their actual traits might be is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side while some even find them lovable and that i find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting

"last night was one of the most thrilling experiences i have had watching a film

i attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house i finally saw a movie i had been yearning for some time i am a little late to the party in regards to my timing of this film but i am ecstatic i got to view it in a theatre i wanted to go in with no expectations because typically i am let down i have a tendency nitpick as a viewer which can make some movies difficult to enjoy i was aware that it had won best foreign film at the golden globes and had received much critical acclaim i cannot recall seeing another bong joon ho film except possibly the host in which case it was so long ago i do not remember either way i was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama with perhaps some suspenseful elements

as i sat in this small cleanly theatre i noticed the majority of people were of asian descent and unless my eyes betrayed me mostly korean i attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd as the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn and drank their cokes i sat there by myself as the only one in my row ready to have a fun experience with whats been regarded as one of the best of the year

the first portion of the movie centers around an engaging korean family who live in a lowerclass part of the city looking for jobs they live in a home that is underground but can still see the street through one of the windows the family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middleaged parents the movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters the first 30 mins is truly a fullblown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing in its own right it is a very effective comedy that had hints of possible dread ahead the hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story",5.0,2020-01-13,imdb
parasite directed by bong joonho how often does one get the opportunity to see a film on the silver screen which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmakers original voice and style of storytelling how often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen and begin writing your very own story bong joonhos parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired its one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world this film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner it doesnt rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination greed family and morality bong joonho and his writer han jinwon craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film parasite tells the story of the kim family which is made of four individuals a father a mother a teenage boy and a teenage girl this family takes interest in the park family who are incredibly rich and wealthy when the teenage boy played exceptionally by choi wooshik takes over his friends job as an english tutor for the daughter of the park family who is a sophomore in high school the film proceeds with the kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the park family who are unaware of this from there one bong joonho and his writer han jinwon tell a beautiful story of family class discrimination empathy and morality in a satirical and dark manner parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling which can leave one entertained thrilled and moved bong joonho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor there are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls,5.0,2019-11-09,imdb
"parasite directed by bong joonho is a masterful blend of dark comedy social commentary and thrilling drama the film follows the impoverished kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy park family leading to unexpected and shocking consequences

the films greatest strength lies in its storytelling bong joonho skillfully balances humor and tension keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout the screenplay is sharp and layered offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy

the performances are stellar across the board song kangho as the kim family patriarch delivers a nuanced performance while the rest of the cast including choi wooshik and park sodam bring depth and authenticity to their roles

visually parasite is stunning with meticulous attention to detail in its production design the contrast between the kims cramped basement home and the parks luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic

however some viewers might find the films tonal shifts jarring and its ending while impactful may not satisfy everyone despite these minor issues parasite is a thoughtprovoking and wellcrafted film that leaves a lasting impression its a unique cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure",3.5,2024-05-27,imdb
"this year the academy awards have gone even more nonsensical than usual not only did they unjusitfiably snub many deserving people and movies but overladened a few films with much more recognition than they deserve

once upon a time in hollywood  10 oscar noms why joker  11 oscar noms why

parasite 6 all deserved

basically the oscars are more of a joke with each passing year however in saying that at least they gave 6 nominations to parasite which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for best film

its the most interesting and engaging movie of the year and the most successful korean movie in history both in korea and around the world i highly recommend it",5.0,2020-01-14,imdb

i cant believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece it was ok at best to me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical i honestly felt like i was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic i think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie,0.5,2020-01-05,imdb
i absolutely loved this film i thought it was sad darkly funny discomfiting and absolutely brilliant its hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away but oh my so many stairways so leaden with meaning if you arent into foreign movies because of the subtitles id still highly recommend seeing this he is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue ive got snowpiercer lined up to watch tomorrow for a fullon bong joonho weekend,5.0,2020-01-11,imdb
the academy awards are in 5 days and parasite is nominated for 6 oscars including best picture i thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and once upon a time in hollywood both films are entertaining throughout the entire runtime but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward this is one to root for at the awards,4.5,2020-02-05,imdb

the movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through the hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and youre completely on edge the last twenty minutes immediately after the movie i was shook to the core afterwards i had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what i just watched and understand the social messages amazing movie and i know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a korean film,5.0,2019-11-27,imdb
i do recommend this film but it definitely isnt the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like the godfather casablanca etc why it received so many accolades is beyond me probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films the acting was fine its the story itself that left a lot to be desired i really had high hopes going into this one at least it didnt fall knee deep into the korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet,3.5,2020-01-05,imdb

"mrs shullivan and i finally decided to sit down and read english subtitles this 2020 academy award best picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough but to win best picture against a great film like once upon a time in hollywood i think director quentin tarantino was absolutely robbed i guess when the usa is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as harvey weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old usa social justice upheavel the academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the best picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive so why not send some awards to south korea

we heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about parasite and i would agree that the first half was decent enough but the latter half i felt i was watching a cheap version of a bruce lee action film

i really enjoyed the cinematography and the set designs were eloquent but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled sort of like when in the 1939 wizard of oz the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her i cannot honestly say this was a memorable film certainly not academy award best picture worthy and i would not recommend this film as a must see such as the 2019 one upon a time in hollywood is a must see at least three times

i give parasite a decent but no higher imdb rating then 6 out of 10",3.0,2020-11-16,imdb
this movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites  the poor are scam artists lying for money and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids but its a mess of a story not a masterpiece in the real world the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead but this movie doesnt have any depth  the symbolism is amateurish the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic the movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming bumbling psychopaths and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless sorry its an ignorant view of the world it makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become or maybe hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one,0.5,2020-02-15,imdb
"i am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from south korea more than lives up to the hype it was the recipient of the palm dor this year at cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews its an absolute masterpiece and one of the best films of the past ten years

i wont say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in south korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible extremely wealthy family the narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary the film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in south korean society but also in the world as a whole from there its main raison dêtre expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations the results are shocking startling hilarious and utterly brilliant such results certainly couldnt be achieved without a truly outstanding cast but lucky for us bong joonho has assembled an astonishing ensemble even more impressive is the films character development while the films primary characters are often not the most ethical they are surprisingly likable and multidimensionalespecially when heightened by both emotion and tone youll certainly remember them long after the credits roll

but whats most unforgettable about parasite is that the film manipulates in the best way possible its tone in so many unique and engaging ways that it is able to fully subvert the viewers expectations of not only how the film will go but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions combining laughoutloud witty comedy taut suspense and moments of pitchblack darkness viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years",5.0,2019-10-20,imdb

"just saw parasite for the first time with subtitles for a foreign film from korea this is very accessible for all languages and audiences the actors are all expressive attractive and do a really good job acting the story has lots of universal contemporary components to it of pop culture

for what its worth the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like south koreas city of god or something along those lines what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed wellwritten and pretty gritty

it starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller part mystery without giving away spoilers

i wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating but unfortunately i just could not sorry but i had to question the ease at which the events unfolded and thats not to say that it wasnt fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the perfect range of storytelling the same issue also arose in the second back half of the movie some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10

however other than these two fairly big big enough to deduct two points flaws the script is practically perfect especially for a foreign film the writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate immerse and challenge your mind while also keeping it entertaining they added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made

i was hoping this would win me over for a best picture oscar upset contender but unfortunately it just didnt quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility",4.0,2020-02-09,imdb
parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though its not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year i have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick the films message is a little on the nose but i dont have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable other than that this film is perfect there is not one bad performance in the movie cho yeojeong park sodam and kangho song are standouts from the film all 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable another aspect i loved was the cinematography the films slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design the films story and themes make this film incredible the story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems its so incredibly tense you never know what is going to happen next and its always surprising to see what eventually happens the film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound the rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family every time this occurs you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense another thing i liked about the film was the score by jung jaeil his score adds so much more to the tension i know im using the word tension a lot but thats what this film is a constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale for me each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat one final aspect i want to touch on is the humor,5.0,2019-10-30,imdb

should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing i really enjoyed bong joonhos memories of a murder and mother unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches the less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father pretentious and anxious mother the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a native american as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set and finally the moody withdrawn awkward daughter the only character with any spark is the previous housemaid the story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls for an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next most notably how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune see the movie and youll see how ridiculous that is the morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened,2.0,2020-02-14,imdb

"directed by bong joonho parasite follows the members of a poor household kim scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family park by posing as unrelated highly qualified individuals

this movie exceeded my expectations what a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary this movie feels like its moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows there isnt a dull moment to it youre either on edge or learning more about its welldefined characters each is distinct and so well performed i recognized koreancanadian actor woosik choi from train to busan hes looking fine in this too btw xd as the brother kiwoo i may be biased because ive grown to really like seeing him but he was my favorite character in this film i see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father really well done applause to you sir

i loved seeing the scheming involved in this with a name like parasite i thought this was going to be scifi in nature but its not at all its more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives the kim family were some sneaky ba let me tell you and i loved it its like a better version of oceans films sorry fans of that series but with less heisting and more actual manual labour but still a lot of deception showing class division without making the rich too villainlike so seeing as the storyscreenplay was superb its of course coupled with great cameraworkvisual representations and an onpoint soundtrack to back it up theres some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you dont have to treat an audience like they need to be spoonfed information which i appreciate a lot im so glad this film had a us",4.5,2020-01-23,imdb

i dont know whether if its just me but each member of the parasitic family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves it is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination onscreen the film starts out portraying the kim family their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich a lucky stone introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait clinging to the narrator throughout the plot the alltoopowerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon one of them leading to the protogonists running away from the affluent parks home after an eventful night this scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers this juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of actions gone too far makes you feel for them the transformation that the narrators father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio economic casteism that is present in our world a brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon,5.0,2019-12-25,imdb

"parasite 2019

1010 

such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end

the struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday no matter the case desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play parasite does away with telling a tale of class greed and the values or family director bong jooho who brought you the host and snowpiercer creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting if you watch youll understand that keeps parasite from ever falling under even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing although it is considered a crimecomedy i found parasite to be a scary type of film think about it manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it no matter how witty andor smart the victim is the horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you getting to the ending which i will discuss briefly without giving anything away is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility its one of those endings that involve so much but that much just happens to work so well in the films favor its haunting its daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark

verdict parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year theres nothing to not like about this and itll sure stay with you after the first viewing",5.0,2019-11-10,imdb

"a family who doesnt have a lot of money or opportunities in life starts working for a wealthy family but will this change the life of the poor family

director bong joon ho screenwriters bong joon ho han jin wan cast song kang ho lee sun kyun cho yeo jeong choi woo shik park so dam lee jung eun chang hyae jin in the movie we follow the kim family who doesnt have much money by chance the son in the family starts working for the wealthy park family he teaches their daughter english now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy park family and then take the jobs themselves

bong joon ho addresses deeper themes but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile the movie is mostly charming until the kim family discovers the big secret of the house

then the movie starts to get darker and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie the title of the movie turns things on its head because what i thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and i got an aha experience parasites are found in all classes of society

from a technical aspect i think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography there are so many beautiful scenes in the movie and its pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big gardenmy favorite sequence is when the kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down and you feel like theyre on board the titanic they must run from the top and down to the engine room what a wonderful sequence and its so beautiful to watch

working with basically two class defining sets parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue director joon hobong and cinematographer kyong pyo hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings situations jabs about class and characters early equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way it adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off with no end game to the plot hobong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic",3.0,2019-11-13,imdb

probably one of the most overrated movies in recent years if i had to summarize this movie to someone that hasnt watched it i would say its a movie about a poor family that manages to get into some rich familys house and they end up being killed by some random psycho that was hiding in the basement for years i liked some parts of the movie especially the first half but it kept getting worse and more random every second what is the moral of this story not having a plan is always better life can change in a split second i dont get the end of the story nor do i know why the guy decided to kill the people he killed the definition of overrated,3.0,2024-01-30,imdb

"last night was one of the most thrilling experiences i have had watching a film

i attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house i finally saw a movie i had been yearning for some time i am a little late to the party in regards to my timing of this film but i am ecstatic i got to view it in a theatre i wanted to go in with no expectations because typically i am let down i have a tendency nitpick as a viewer which can make some movies difficult to enjoy i was aware that it had won best foreign film at the golden globes and had received much critical acclaim i cannot recall seeing another bong joon ho film except possibly the host in which case it was so long ago i do not remember either way i was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama with perhaps some suspenseful elements

as i sat in this small cleanly theatre i noticed the majority of people were of asian descent and unless my eyes betrayed me mostly korean i attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd as the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn and drank their cokes i sat there by myself as the only one in my row ready to have a fun experience with whats been regarded as one of the best of the year the first portion of the movie centers around an engaging korean family who live in a lowerclass part of the city looking for jobs they live in a home that is underground but can still see the street through one of the windows the family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middleaged parents the movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters the first 30 mins is truly a fullblown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing in its own right it is a very effective comedy that had hints of possible dread ahead the hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story",5.0,2020-01-09,imdb
"winner of the palme dor for best film in cannes 2019 to say parasite is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament when you have to spill blood in a film you have to dose it with genius hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and above all understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well

dont get me wrong parasites is not a bloody drama but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art it is a tragicomedy about love life and death it is a film about the joy of living about survival about the family of the 21st century but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many that sick stifled definition confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values it is about real and living families of the planet in 2019 many dispossessed and a few privileged in a game of services and currency exchanges in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence horror and death

although director bong joonho has already made about ten feature films of various themes i only know one of his films the cult fable the guest a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of seoul that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the han river by an american scientist kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus again in parasite bong addresses the family issue opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children to a rich family with the same number of members the moment they cross roads is the basis of the story a third component personified by a housekeeper gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax which is not the end of the fascinating story at this point of the story it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell until the sad final closeup that ends this work",5.0,2019-12-05,imdb
"so maybe im an uncultured swine or maybe some of the effect was lost in translation but whatever it may be im not sure i understand the hype around this movie

dont get me wrong it was good but it wasnt all that to be honest i thought it was just above average i think i may have liked it more if it was a bit more concise the almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place there were definitely solid moments throughout good acting and a general level of engagement it just didnt super draw me in

i think if i had watched this without being privy to any of the hype i might have liked it more but i guess i was just slightly disappointed regardless this is for sure a fun and thrilling movie that i would still recommend",3.0,2024-01-19,imdb
"this film shows humanity in all its glory we can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better people are terrible they are selfish they are greedy they are unkind its part of human nature no matter how much you have or how little humanity still exists and humanity is the problem

all the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human nothing we can do about it

the movie was good lol",4.5,2020-01-14,imdb
"this movie is a vastly overrated film but still had some cool moments it just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit the story is good but it just goes on and on without any real purpose it doesnt really go anywhere until the mid point which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt but it just sort of stops then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes friday the 13th

the biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters they have no backstory they are poor and nothing else they cant even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10 from them they are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers they cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them they go into peoples house and stay there while the people go on trips you just dont feel for them and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers

in the end it had some cool and intense scenes a hot sex scene some cool violent scenes but it is not a masterpiece the story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started snowpiercer is a masterpiece go watch that instead

there are many reasons why korean movies are a top notch and bong joon is definitely one of those this lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride the movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events the movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them its a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for which side to take excellent,4.5,2020-02-01,imdb
"a movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in

the director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a godtier build up with twisted plot this is brilliant  you dont have to complicate it in order to get audience attention

"while many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached it starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction when the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in she then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases the last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion all these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment i found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it

the performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless the soundtrack stayed in the background and i dont remember any of it

the elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie while i agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that i have very little knowledge about south korea metaphors do not make a movie magically better while telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment the movie cannot stand on it alone i would not have enjoyed or rewatched memento if its gimmick of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer the craftsmanship of memento was really good from both actors and crew i missed the good craftsmanship in parasite especially from the actors",3.0,2021-04-16,imdb

snowpiercer was very good parasite is even better bong joonho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller which is horror film comedy and drama at the same time a poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them but who are the real parasites the society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity  but its precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford and it shouldnt fool us about the balance of economic power we dont see good or bad individuals in parasite rather bong joonho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations moreover parasite is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie in which there isnt a single wrong picture,5.0,2019-11-02,imdb

"edit after the oscars craze i felt compelled to talk about the good but overrated comments that i see more and more parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art its very easily digestible by the masses as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even marveldcaudiences can enjoy however this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors theyre subtle enough though that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect those who seek an important and complex message can find it and those who seek a 2hour entertainment can also find it therefore we have the good but overrated phenomenon

ive just recently been introduced to the skorean film industry after a long break from contemporary hollywood movies my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to skorean films i firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big hollywood blockbusters and what ive experienced with korean cinema so far just for reference the korean movies ive seen so far are basically crimedramamystery movies with my top 3 being 1 parasite 2 the chaser 3 memories of murder but there are many that ive yet to watch what all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be areal enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world bfunny with respect to the story and the characters and c weirdly they felt like they werent trying too much i dont know if its just me being sick of all the hollywoods trying to be super cool act but i find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics and i find that very hard to do it really is a thin line i am so excited to have discovered s",5.0,2019-11-18,imdb
a raw portrayal of south korean society where wealth inequality is at an alltime high the film depicts a poor family forced to survive by clinging onto  even parasitizing  a wealthy household the harsh reality it unveils is more brutal than i ever anticipated the title may sound like japans parasite but theres nothing supernatural herejust the raw complex layers of human nature on display i dont want to spoil anything but the tragic end for both the rich and poor families speaks volumes this isnt just a glimpse into south korean society as seen on tv it hints at darker more horrifying societal issues lurking beneath the surface,3.5,2024-11-01,imdb

i particularly loved how the director filmed the locations and used light sound and suspense to great effect

i cannot recommend this enough

"a few moments into the movie you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings

director bong joon ho has dabbled in murder mysteries dystopian science fiction as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh empathise grin and sit at the edge of your seat by winning the palme dor at cannes and hosting sold out screenings parasite had placed bong joon ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema

the best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters which brings me praise kangho sok who plays the father of the kim family making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family

the cinematography in parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of kim familys semibasement house and polished expanse of park familys uptown villa the background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in while enhancing the drama

while parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages it communicates class divide makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves and makes you question who is the real parasite in the movie

parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019 bong joonhos satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun its easy to see why it did as well as it did,3.5,2021-10-30,imdb
cant believe it won both foreign and america best film some sloppy writing for instance the kim family is drunk in the parrks homeall of a sudden they become sober they throw glasses and bottles on the floor then its cleaned up with no one cleaning it when the two kids are under the ottoman hiding theres no sign of broken anything also the ex maid has been hiding her husband in the cellar for years why and shes been moving the big chest to get down there to care for him all these years then when she returns she cant open the secret door so the kim family can see her how did she manage all the years before this particular night the film is very mean spirited and theres nobody to root for except for the poor man who gets killed again sloppy writing the premise is good but the execution is bad oh and the young kid gets strangled and his head is hit with a large rock he recovers with nary a scratch again poor writing movie makes no sense on the plus side the acting is good,1.5,2020-07-18,imdb

the visual storytelling here is immaculate the stair sequence in particular is incredibly craftedthe sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right placesthis is probably the bestpaced film ive seen this year theres virtually nothing i could think of to trim

i am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms you dont need me for plot summary theres plenty of that online already though i would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps

the acting is all excellent song kangho continues to be one of the best actors working today the dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other

this is a very rich film with metaphors as the young hero of it might say it is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction writing and acting are very cleverly done the themes of the havenots against the haves and the coldhearted versus the warmerhearted people dominate the plot which is thick there is a lot of symbolism in it who are the real parasites anyway the poor or the wealthy the caring or the indifferent the tone takes a turn threequarters of the way through from frenchfarce style to almost a horror film however it is worth engaging in until its conclusion as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed i can see why it won the palme dor at cannes in 2019 its a gem,5.0,2019-11-02,imdb

parasite is itself a parasite of a movie the start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film its a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions there are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution what kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending this is it makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up one who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it because there was some good acting and great film work i gave it five stars but it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie,2.5,2020-01-06,imdb
"this film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows the duality between the protagonist family and the rich parks is shown in such a wonderful realistic manner this type of storytelling has been long missing and i hope more movie makers follow in this trend  in their own original way of course

my one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts some scenes last longer than they should this could be a cultural difference in filmmaking as another south korean film i watched had these instances as well still its not enough for me to completely give up on it its a proper thriller american films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade but failed with the exception of get out you laugh youre sent to the edge of your seat you get angry and finally you feel sad you know a movie is great when its able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after youve watched it

im glad south korean films are getting the attention they deserve ive watched other south korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers congratulations to everyone involved with this film you all did an amazing job and im happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level

"parasite is a south korean movie directed by joon ho bong who also directed snowpiercer okja and most brilliantly mother now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films which is saying a lot

you never know where the story is headed so theres a lot of suspense throughout the film at first youre given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty their wifi doesnt work their basement dwelling gets flooded and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists thats actually one of the things that bothers me about the film all of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims i wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves i wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did poverty isnt enough

even so the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged the conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour after that a curveball is thrown at them as well as us the audience

and again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset im sorry to point this out again but it gets irksome i expected more from the director of the masterpiece mother that is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous despite all my criticisms parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety",3.5,2019-08-27,imdb
"im sorry am i missing something here every celebrity message board poster and even the former president of the united states obama are saying this was the best movie of the year

its just not good why is this being considered one of the best of the year im totally lost this is one of the most forgettable movies i have ever seen to put it bluntly even michael bays worst transformers movie is better than this dreck

i came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next city of god based on the hype its actually on the level of a movie on netflix that id spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking thumbs down

dont waste your time trust me on this

i forgot to add its very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off shameless in many ways they were definitely inspired by it",0.5,2019-12-30,imdb
"i guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people this is a very very powerful film very clever but even this film cant depict the real poverty if youve watched it and are reading this very review you aint poor the real poor dont watch this film this film might have depicted struggles but real life is on another level

and no i dont know what its like either but i can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey on their fierce face i dont see any extra thoughts no concerns about ethnicity pain or morality but the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner

there isnt any flamboyance in that there is only straight up desire and the feed for that desire",4.0,2020-01-17,imdb
as a longtime fan of bong and song i always knew this pair would make it at cannes someday and finally _ naneon bongiiyah i purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and im glad it turned out bong had made up for okja very successfully also id like to add that moongwang the former housekeeper was ridiculously good despite all the laughs throughout the movie its quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical absurd society where we live in all the way back home i hope bongs next movie would be just as good as parasite,5.0,2019-05-30,imdb
"parasite review 1010

snowpiercer director bong joonho has made a south korean social satire thats also a genrebending palme dorwinning thriller of class struggle its best to go into parasite the cannes film festival grandprize winner by korean filmmaker bong joonho not knowing too much about what youre about to see the better to let its sly power sneak up on you a dark satire of the class divide in contemporary south korea its the story of two families of four youll watch knowing youre in the hands of a master filmmaker only wondering when its over how certain effects were achieved a sequence near the end is a wonder and losing yourself in these characters particularly the gentle wideeyed anxiety of mrs park and the way that kiwoos father a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again the title metaphor becomes abundantly clear is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the parks cant imagine or dont care to imagine how the other half lives in one scene they coolly discuss how poor people smell like an old radish says mr park or a rag thats been boiled kiwoos family however seems to understand the rich all too well what keeps you rapt in parasite is the visual wit every shot distills the movies themes and the richness of the characters and performances songs stricken expression as kim sr is driven to murder by class resentment lee jeongeuns swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman and chois eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust at the heart of parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all the inability to protect ones family parents work to save their children but lose them as children lose their parents and wives their husbands",5.0,2019-11-06,imdb
"possibly the best film ive seen for some time yes i have a few lockdown blues and needed something to cause a bit of escapism parasite was the answer its one of those films thats almost impossibility to classify it doesnt really fit into any specific genre but covers almost all of them

a great start it holds your attention incredibly well i enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film i know some didnt it just moves you into a totally different place

youll laugh and cry youll lose yourself in the wonder do yourself a favour and order it 1010",5.0,2020-05-07,imdb

one of the best movies ive seen in a long time i dont usually give 10 points but the film impressed me its been a month since im still in effect the way he describes events and emotions is very interesting i follow south korean films as much as possible i have not seen this kind of narration either in south korean cinema or in other countries i would really recommend to anyone interested in cinema and looking for new things bong joon ho is an excellent director every job is getting better and better,5.0,2019-12-28,imdb
this movie is nice and the idea is interesting but its not the best movie of 2019 its totally overrated,3.5,2020-02-23,imdb
the west favors the films that look western in its aesthetics and treatment this film is the example a commercial illogical potboiler with not one original character this film can be compared to a number of hollywood european cinema everything is stupid and illogical an entire family cons another entire family into entering their home as servants in various capacity top it with a secret bunker in the basement where the previous servant has kept her husband to save him from debtors and the owners of the house a family of 4 has no clue about any of it despite all these happening right under their noses for years sounds stupid and illogical and nonsensical sounds like a hollywood b comedy movie starring queen latheefa adam sandler will ferrel and other snl cast members,0.5,2020-01-09,imdb
incredible film making acting and story really transported me,5.0,2019-11-18,imdb
i dont watch many nonenglish language films but i think parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film although i dont see it as a masterpiece i think there are a lot of highlevel elements of filmmaking in this the plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings the acting is great as well as the direction but im always feeling like im missing the full experience when subtitles dont convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references but that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country 810,4.0,2020-02-08,imdb
when i heard about parasite i heard about the overwhelming praise first normally when a movie gets a 99 on rt i end up liking them but i never rave about them boyhood and get out are prime examples so i went into parasite with caution but i was wrong it really is that good not good its excellent brilliant genius i could go on and on from the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design the acting the script its all perfect i dont want to give away anything because if you go in completely blind youll walk away with the best film of the year worming through your brain,5.0,2020-02-10,imdb
thats the whole point ive seen some reviewers here say that the poor family infiltrating the rich family so easily and skillfully felt like a feel good movie to let us root for the underdog people and cheer for them when they succeed the directer clearly intentionally led the plot to be such so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morallity of the rich and poor families are the rich really evil for ignoring the poor does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them how people dont get the point of social commentary and only focuses on plot details and improbablity is just sad,5.0,2019-10-30,imdb
"this movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an english tutor for a rich girl but what unravels is an extraordinary story of power greed insanity manipulation and false appearances its a slow rise to disconcerting uncomfortable and then all of the sudden it is disturbing and gory and insane

there is no way to see whats coming next i promise you that now thats a real thriller

highly recommend the ending leaves questions unanswered but many opportunities to philosophize on humanity and class",5.0,2019-12-28,imdb
"this is one of the best movies of the new century all characters are real and to some extent relatable while the movie is korean and leverages korean culture in many parts the multicultural universal takes what made this movie so great

the movie was well written well acted well paced well filmed well scored everything was pretty good for me it is a far cry from the best film ive seen it might not even be in the top 10 dont get me wrong it was a very good movie worth watching and worth watching on the big screen i dont really get the masterpiece and best film ever comments it was entertaining and thought provoking go see it but ignore the super reviews as well as the bad reviews,3.5,2020-02-01,imdb
now thats how you make a movie kudos to the writerdirector cast and crew for making such a neoclassic work of art if this movie doesnt win some oscars itll be a crime against humanity,5.0,2020-01-29,imdb
"so i finally watched parasite while the film was not bad and had a different view on social disparity between rich and poor i still think that this film did not deserve to win best picture at the oscars

for a best picture type of film i expect more top visuals scenery camera sound effects music mixing wardrobe and of course great actors and a really great story while those actors werent especially bad they were not great either especially the rich woman acted over the top

now the story for me this story was unfolding to easy too cheap at the start of the movie the poor family is depicted as lazy and especially the parents seem to have bad manors there are those kind of poor people that got hit hard by economy and try to work their way up again and there are those that just live on the money of others and are not willing to work hard themselves the family in parasite falls into the second category they are not even able to fold pizza card boxes correctly nor do they care to present good work results or make a good impression to keep their jobs yet this same family is able to get jobs at a rich familiys home and those rich people the father is a business man  so not a dumb person arent suspicious or realize that they are impostors the lazy woman from the start now runs the whole household as a maid nor do they ask their rich friends or business partners if they know someone for a drivers or a maids job nope they just pick the first one that someone unknown recommends that worked for them for just a few hours

the worst about the story i could not sympathise with the poor family in the end it was not like yeah they were treated unfair by society and had to live a poor live in the basement they deserve better in contrary especially when they found out that the former maid has hidden her husband in the basement for several years this parasite family does not connect with those people",3.0,2022-05-20,imdb
ridiculous implausible plot heavy handed allegory at best overdrawn caricatures of rich and poor i guess some viewers found this funny but nobody laughed in the theater the worst was the gratuitous violence near the end shown with graphic detail,0.5,2020-01-04,imdb
it starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change general look at parasite its true to say that its kind of horror movie couse of the main idea people like kim family lives in the real world society and doing parasiting to other people this is one of the best movies in 2019 and directors best work after snowpiercer,4.5,2020-01-24,imdb
i went into this movie without knowing anything about it i had no expectations whatsoever but holy hell does it deliver it is one of the best films i have ever seen its constantly evolving never boring and so unpredictable bong joon ho is truly a genius and this is pure art everything about this film is perfect there is not one thing i could name that i would change about it it deserves all the praise it is getting what a film,5.0,2020-02-10,imdb
the plot is awesome bang jon hoo know how to portait the background team worked hard to deliver this simple but awesome thriller that changed every cinematic experience i have ever seen actors are perfect everyone must see can be seen with family,5.0,2020-02-10,imdb
"parasite is if not the best definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019 the film is almost perfect in every aspect possible

both the cinematographer kyungpyo hong and the director bong joonho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts these three aspects together result in one of the most eyegrabbing movies of the decade every shot is at the same time beautiful and meaningful to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues

the screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film bong joonho and han jinwon came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny interesting sarcastic sad and verisimilar the movie shows the difference between classes like roma 2018 but has the rhythm and its core similar to get out 2017

every character is important and has its moment of protagonism due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay none of the characters is a villain or a hero the only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones

the acting by all the main cast is sublime but the highlights are kangho song and yeojeong jo kangho plays kim kitaek father of the kim family he captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie making his characters arc of development the most interesting of the film yeojeong plays yeongyo mother of the park family she is the complete opposite of kitaek shes naive and has and seemingly has always had an easy life shes clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the kim family

last but definitely not least the music",4.5,2020-01-25,imdb
"everyone said go see parasite everyone said the one rule about parasite is that you dont talk about parasite so i went to see parasite so this is a review about parasite without talking about parasite

kim kiwoo woosik choi is a student living with his family in poverty in a subbasement room sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living of sorts by assembling pizza boxes opportunity presents itself when his best friend the slightly older min seojoon park goes abroad to study for min is an english tutor to the upmarket park familys schoolage daughter dahye jiso jung not wanting his fellow fratboys to move in on future romance  hes lined up kiwoo as his replacement

kiwoo knows hes lucked in when he visits the swanky park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of dahyes not too bright mother yeonkyo yeojeong jo but the influence of the familys lucky rock doesnt stop there kiwoo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister kim sodam park his father kitaek kangho song and his mother chungsook hyejin jang and gradually the poor kim family start to encroach on the rich park familys lives

you might think thats the story its not just when you think you know where the film is going  a gentle comic tale with farcical elements  the movie takes a sudden left turn into the twilight zone

to say more if youve not seen the film would be cruelty beyond measure its a truly astonishing script by writerdirector bong joon ho and my nomination for the oscar for best original screenplay

its the details that get to you this will be a superb film to watch multiple times there are fabulous details scattered throughout you know how the more expensive the car the more solid the clunk is as you shut the door listen to the sound effect when the park front door shuts look what happens to the one of a kind lucky rock",5.0,2020-02-09,imdb

"9 star rating from yms and a palm dor what have we here a dark comedy from a great korean director going back to his roots nois ill make sure i pay close attention to this one

as expected this film is good however it could have easily been bad if not for the brilliant cinematography strong directorial sense and most of all thought provoking messages and philosophies that dont hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society however you arent here to see me laud you want to know why i dont hold it in as high regards as everyone else

the film feels messy although the comedy is often effective i dont think it fits well enough in this context the story is innovative though it does feel familiar in certain parts the sudden mood changes arent my cup of tea as well

a lot of the plot points are just too over the top they can be distracting they can be too weird especially regarding the climaxending youll know what i mean there are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end or maybe i need more time to think about them who knows lastly the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in

it is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers at the end of the day ill still highly recommend this film because after all it is a good film and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture but im still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much i guess im not too appreciative of korean films considering my 710 rating for the handmaiden but this is open to change and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me i may learn to like it much more than i do",3.5,2019-06-21,imdb

i watched parasite out of curiousity after it won the oscar well i watched half of it and fast forwarded through part the trailer repelled me so i decided not to watch it before this point the cinematography was wonderful but once again my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film i found the movie sadistic and disturbing rather than a provoking statement about class i saw a dark sick film laced with contempt gratuitous violence caricatures of people and unlikeable characters with no moral compass how utterly depressing",0.5,2020-02-19,imdb

it is always exciting to see what the frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come springtime little did i expect cannes film festival to award the prestigious palme dor this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakersuntil now bong joonhos english film debut 2013s snowpiercer struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017s okja was cartoonish and hamfisted it didnt help that hed relegated two of my favorite actors tilda swinton and jake gyllenhaal to cringeinducing careerlow sideshow performers besides that i just couldnt vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of familyfriendly cuteness ultra violence and quirky humor it reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn with that said let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations parasite is easily one of the best movies ive seen this year however theres the other genetically engineered super pig in the room parasite has an awful lot in common with last years palme dor winner shoplifters putting aside that the former is a korean production and the latter was japanese both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society running cons and scams to get by in a callous world they are held together by their honest love for one another and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place but the main way that joonho oneups his awardwinning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character a humor that is immediately physically translatable despite the language barrier,5.0,2020-02-03,imdb

not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does there are many layers to the plot theres the events that youre watching but theres also a deeper layer that youre almost compelled to think about as you watch everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but i think everyone will get something valuable from it i would recommend 100 percent,5.0,2020-02-03,imdb
its been a while since i watched a movie that made such impact on me first of all i really liked the story of different social classes despair greed deception pride and prejudices it is masterfully directed by bong carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing parasite cant be categorized in a specific movie genre rather its a mix of dark comedy drama and thriller which is its strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres this is movie that i will gladly watch many times a real gem of korean cinematography,5.0,2020-02-02,imdb

one of the best movies ive ever seen this movie is full of wonderful surprises the scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as its overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in mr parks house also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satiricallaughed out loud i have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movieit also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the park family although they are deceiving them the whole movie took me by surprise and i didnt see any of it coming its really clever i laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so the director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off i also have to admit i was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed its a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality meritocracy social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you dont have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie this movie is for everyone satirical metaphorical genius paradoxical impulsive genuine watch this movie,5.0,2020-02-04,imdb
"rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet sets up a standard feel good movie scenario seemingly innocuous parasite captures the lively trials of the kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment starting an invasion of sorts the web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible park family opens a series of mouth watering doors but alas theres always some that should remain shut

whether its borders classes or smells everyone has a line that once crossed destroys most semblance of rationale parasite brilliantly dissects how these boundaries however personal and subjective are developed within our very complicated and unique species

filmed almost exclusively within the two families domiciles one a filthy cramped basement apartment the other a glorious spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill parasite offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling

delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies hammer throw expertise american indian infatuations and wifi signal hunting are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act sides are drawn early on making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare but not everything on screen is black and white the consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film what is good what is evil how is that line drawn

yesterday at around the beginning of the third act i came to and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention then at the roll of the credits i had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movielaughing and awestruck by what id just experienced it had been a long time since a movie had given this effect and its original films like this that come out of nowhere every onceinawhile and today i know for sure i have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem parasite because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece this is my first and most definitely not my last foreign film to make this list of the greatest im so thrilled that i was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what i thought makes a movie great bong joon ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every societyso it is not just relatable to koreans the genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy drama suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end it is both moving and thoughtprovoking but is also a movie id recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life it is an allaround masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast a great ensemble of talented actorsincluding hos long time collaborator kangho songmake watching every character on screen a moment not to miss when there is so much chemistry within an onscreen family you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story you just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven,5.0,2020-02-07,imdb
"reviewing this movie is a unique challenge for me as a japanese person ive always had a special connection to asian cinema even if i havent always been a fan of the style my interest in korean and japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles its not that these movies are bad its just that my preferences lean elsewhere

however there are exceptions one korean movie that truly left a mark on me is oldboy if you havent seen it yet i urge you to skip the hollywood remake and dive straight into the original this movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling

the same feeling applies to parasite again i need to become more familiar with the director and actors i went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises awards and the surprising oscar nomination for both the best international movie and best movie categories of course i had to check it out

when i first sat down to watch parasite i had no idea what to expect the movie starts off like a sliceoflife soap opera a slow burner that gradually builds tension but as the story unfolds the tension escalates leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat

i cant speak too much not to spoil the surprises and twists and oh boy there are many twists to this plot its best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised

overall the directing is superb the screenplay is not complicated and its very well written the acting is also competent mixing moments of comedy and tension very well but it feels dry if it makes any sense

this is definitely only a movie for some and as i have minimal exposition to korean filmmaking i dont have many other references than oldboy and the rest of the vengeance trilogy movies which im not too fond of so much but oldboy has such a visceral punch that its hard to forget even years after i watched it",3.5,2024-06-02,imdb
i was excited to see parasite due to rave reviews and it winning best picture i was warned by a theater worker that the first halfhour is slow but then it gets really good so i made it through the first halfhour and kept waiting for the really good part only to find out that it was the exact same more tedium by a family that was not really likable the violence was not necessary either and seemed to be a way to make it oscar worthy a lot of oscar nominated movies have violence at the end and that seems to be a way to get more respect or something it was sad and horrible in my opinion i cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie compared to 1917 little women and once upon a time in hollywood won best picture honestly what is going on with those who vote that vote for this drivel it was okay dont get me wrong but thats allmerely okay for the record i love movies with subtitles and have seen several amazing ones but this was not one of them,0.5,2020-02-16,imdb
i really enjoyed this film because bong joonho perfectly masters its original and impactful story of the underprivileged family who uses all the means at their disposal to rise in society although they are aware that there have no place the best aspect of this film is that it takes no sides in the script in addition this film is wonderfully topical although it only briefly touches on subjects such as social networks it does this very effectively by mixing thriller and comedy,4.0,2020-02-03,imdb
"bong joonho is a south korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film the bong hive being the name of his devoted fanbase his latest film parasite gets a long awaited release in the uk and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make

all unemployed kitaek song kangho and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous parks as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident

parasite is an absolute triumph from bong joonho his film building and building to a crescendo that i didnt see coming at all its a brilliantly written film the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking theres a real intricacy to the screenplay cowritten by bong and han jinwon taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hardhitting

it isnt just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy the production design on parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold the time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the parks family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its mazelike features almost serving as a character itself hong kyungpyos sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lowerclass neighbourhood where the kims actually live is beautifully neat and yang jinmos score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess

coming to the performances parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season its very much an ensemble piece each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the standouts for me were song kangho park sodam and cho yeojeong",5.0,2020-02-04,imdb
"parasite impressed me enough that i wanted to see it again having done so ive increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10

what i thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that i had missed in my initial viewing and with the element of surprise gone i could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives i especially liked that no one here is 100 blameless or 100 evil that kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life i only wish it were more common in movies

this time i also paid much closer attention to the films abundant symbolism admittedly though i still couldnt figure out the significance of the scholars rock but that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film

if not the for the irishman i would root for parasite as this years best picture winner still its a shooin for best foreign language film",5.0,2020-02-03,imdb
"what is parasite  a satire sarcasm humor emotion human condition suspense thriller social issues drama thought provoking dialogues strong and smooth acting  all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style

it is an unconventional storytelling it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor the beauty of cinema lies in its frame because thats the window through which we watch and experience the story and thats where comes the cinematography and the production design it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision  every frame every shot is unforgettable another unconventional part of this movie is its background score we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos may be the background score is inspired from hitchcock movies

this film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching it stays with you even if you want you cant escape from them then slowly you learn to live with them in your head because you are also one of them it is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again probably because you want to laugh cry and get scared  all at the same time

parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence kudos to director bong joonho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world",5.0,2020-02-08,imdb
"ive loved every film of bong joon hos that ive scene dating back to the host one of the premier auteurs of our generation this film did what so few films do in our current era it genuinely surprised the film is as authentically original and inspired as people are saying it is

a great movie not a dull moment what a great script  acting and directing probably one of the most original and entertaining film ive seen in many years a tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre,4.5,2020-02-05,imdb
"ive wanted to watch this for a while because of the high praise it has gotten however i think this made my experience worse because i had such high expectations i felt a bit underwhelmed by this movie

personally i thought the first hour was unimaginably boring supposedly this is part comedy i dont know where the comedy part was to be honest

the pace picked up in the second part but im not sure if i liked this much better our main characters suddenly became so incompetent it made the plot go into a bit of a weird direction

i have a conflicted opinion on this on one hand i can tell this movie had some real skills behind it the camera shots the acting the details everything was thought through and that was quite obvious for example i did appreciate the progression towards the dads breakdown the way we get little details on mr park although nice at first we get more clues on how he sees his staff as less than him the way he held his nose as he picked up his keys

also the very subtle hints at that the family is basically useless at everything making you wonder who is really the parasite

so i get it the symbolisms metaphors the cinematography was skillful

but if i think only 10 was wowworthy that doesnt make up for the other 90 maybe it needed that 90 for that 10 but the 90 was just not enjoyable if a movie is not enjoyable it defeats the purpose of a movie movies can be an artform but its still supposed to give the watcher a good experience in this case it just didnt give me that as much as i wanted it to",3.0,2024-08-19,imdb

the movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end

sad open ended finale

fairly well told story of struggles hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax the irrational abrupt unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood the climax will also reveal grave weaknesses of the plot which cant help leading to an inevitable low key ending,3.0,2020-02-14,imdb

"this films ranking here on imdb is somewhat of an anomaly usually when a hot new release makes its way into the top 250 it manages to remain in its general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote parasite entered the list in the mid fifties if i correctly recall and since then has managed to improve its position to 26 as i write this no one knows if that will hold obviously so im curious to see how the movie rates over time

having stated that i thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the kim family maneuver its way into the life and home of the park family what was questionable to me was why the kims werent able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when min seojoon park suggested the tutoring job to kiwoo woosik choi each of the kims demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long its not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition because once that ambition kicked into gear there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the parks not that it wasnt done by underhanded or devious means but with those kinds of street smarts they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood but that was the set up so you have to go with it

where the story begins to go off the rails is when the kims luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak personally i would never have allowed the former housekeeper moongwang jeongeun lee unescorted access to the park home when she came calling to rescue her husband though it revealed the hidden areas of the park home they would have been discovered by the kims had they followed and observed moongwang to begin with",4.0,2020-01-26,imdb
good show fun ride quite fresh definitely not overdone but at a 86 rating the community is saying its better than the green mile whiplash interstellar gladiator and terminator 2 i personally do not think its on that level yet maybe its score has to do with how all the indian shows are highly rated on here,3.5,2021-03-05,imdb
"bong joonhos parasite is perfectly written filmed and played  a bit too much at times did we need this ri chunhees impersonation or was that a bonus for western audiences

no spoilers but youre forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan to want to know among all possible worst case scenarios which one will prevail and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating then overflowing this over the top gem

"so you think youre going to fast track your way to the good life huh by taking a short cut here a little lying and deceiving there

well maybe it seems to work for some why not for you i mean how else did they get there right by being honest oh please

so you decide to take the easy road one lie opens one door then another and yet another

things seem to be going so well for you youre getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices all of this unearned wealth is just within your reach

but one night

lightning  thunder 

comes a flood

and the entire foundation your life is built on washes away

turns out all those lies short cuts and easy way outs were not good building material

you had the wrong plan you walked the wrong path and you made the wrong sacrifices

you thought you were taking the easy way out the short cut

look at how wrong you were

in the end you lost everything your sister your father your home your freedom your health

tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out

my god would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start

i guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow

"when it comes to foreign films i tend to be a little biased or lenient they are such a welcome break from traditional hollywood when i see a decent foreign film i cant help but want to praise it more because they dont have the multibillion dollar hollywood machine behind them usually they have to be more creative more ingenious and more resourceful

parasite is one of very few korean films ive watched in my life my foreign film bank consists mostly of chinese kungfu movies of which jackie chan and jet li probably occupy the most space korean films are a rarity for me this suspenseful thriller by bong joonho deserves all of the accolades it has received

what i knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them that is essentially what happened but youre not holding anyones attention with that concept alone each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable as the movie developed and we saw the kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the park family we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script

how do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either some how parasite did that the kim family certainly was shady and underhanded but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead the park family was wealthy yet unlike your average rich movie family they were not cruel or unbearable people in fact they were very likeable

normally we want our clearcut good guys and bad guys we want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose in the cases where all of our guys are good we want them all to win in the cases where all our guys are bad we want them all to lose in parasite not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners",4.0,2020-01-22,imdb
this movie starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities this movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in todays world almost as spltited as in gosford park it also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience,5.0,2019-08-12,imdb
the parasite is nothing short of masterpiece proof that asian directors are one of best in the world it is also well acted all actors did amazing job the main theme is social classes some scenes especially the evening when it rained were devastating but beside that i found family relationships to be very good represented,5.0,2019-08-20,imdb

easily one of the best movies of the year because of many aspects first the acting is awesome really strong performances by everyone second the story is very interesting and last but not least the sequence of events in this movie is one if the years best i mean every act is great on its own but if you put them all together you will witness a masterpiece and if you watch any of them by itself you will get an amazing shortfilm considering thd oscars this one is a strong nomination for best foreign language picture and i wouldnt be surprised if it gets a nomination for the best picture award,5.0,2019-12-30,imdb

i was expecting something deeply profound and artistic and this just wasnt either of those things this is a horrible example of trying to expand ones cinematic palate to foreign films because there are wonderful foreign films out there im guessing the people that liked this also thought mother was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece",1.5,2020-04-17,imdb
"parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you the script reminds me of billy wilder it switches from comedy to drama because life is like that the directing is flawless acting is compelling but the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society weve come to create in the xxi century with no social mobility it is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible

this film must be seen by anyone who loves movies it is one that will stand the test of time hollywood be worried with your generic formulas korea is the new power house and parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right american audiences should read subtitles for once this movie will make you laugh and cry the story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle its a must watch a masterpiece",5.0,2019-10-21,imdb
"bong joonho is a director that ill definitely check out more i loved snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone parasite is nothing short of genius

its best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what i can say is that parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible this film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions there are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent bong joonho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible

the story of parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety bong joonho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch their motivations and state make them believable to the audience the events that unfold dont come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing

aside from the story this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019 the colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous there is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic the editing is fantastic as the films pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever the aesthetics on the whole is top notch

i thought knives out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of parasite is extraordinary everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles

i really tried to think of flaws but as of now i could not find any everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense",5.0,2020-01-26,imdb

there have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary all while telling an airtight and compelling story luckily for us parasite gisaengchung checks all of these boxes in a year where we couldnt have needed it more badly bong joonhos latest absolutely blows all else out of the water at least compared to the other 30 movies ive seen in theaters this year and in a highly organic and original way the issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that bong joonho is wellknown for using for instance in 2013s snowpiercer yet parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way this is the films greatest strength in my opinion that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components including an interesting and nuanced take on classstructure originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told the same can be said for how bong traverses from one genre to another from minute to minute parasite will have you laughing uproariously and then suddenly have you deadsilent and on the edge of your seat the comedy is dark and laughoutloud while the suspense will make you want to lean in if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene so as to relieve the tension it should be no surprise that everything else also falls into place wonderfully from the poignant performances to the razor sharp editing to the stunning cinematography in a year with both highbudget and indie takes on classstruggle such as joker and us parasite still manages to stand out in a class of its own,5.0,2019-11-17,imdb
"this film is always one step ahead of its audience you are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift the question of whos right or whos wrong isnt so much as being poised by the master director bong joonho its being slammed over your head with a rock and when you recover and the audience claps the answer still isnt clear

parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received that i saw this in a packed theater with an adoring fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart its cinema at its best

as many folks are noting and i will reiterate go into this cold read as little about it as possible if you can it will make the experience so much better this is one i know i will be revisiting often over the years enjoy it",4.5,2020-01-13,imdb

unsure how this won an oscar and has such a high rating thought the same with spirited away appears that these movies won oscars for being different to the hollywood norm i think so anyway

it was a fun watch but not the best of movies like others would suggest if you have seen many korean movies before you will understand that they dont follow the typical hollywood formula watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing korean movies

with all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the oscar for best picture i was expecting a lot more out of this movie the story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me theres a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a wellwritten script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as im accustomed to through american film im very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this i give it 510,2.5,2020-03-18,imdb

every single thing

the acting is great the pacing is amazing it always feels like something is happening and you wont get bored the message isnt scream out at the audience you need to read between the lines the characters are well developed theres no hero or villain you can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do there are violence comedy action suspense and romance honestly i wasnt expecting much and i find myself really

damn you south korea this is a top notch movie with high effective result storyline acting bgm and colour grading were so catchy after watching this movie only one question is bouncing in my head who is the parasite ,5.0,2019-12-17,imdb
"the scene where the old maid arrives in the video at the door after the doorbell ring was so creepy and i loved the scene where the family is getting drunk and talking around the table after dinner the montage with the peach was also masterful as was the way many scenes were filmed styled and handled i loved how the old maid also got them on cell phone video proving they were all a family and knew each other and then blackmailed them temporarily

the young kim family sister is an extremely talented actress and so is the parks pampered wife the other actors were all solid as well the story is universal and pop cultured so it is relevant and easy to follow for all languages and nationalities

the movie is never uninteresting even when it slows down a little in its final half hour or so it remains intriguing but this is the only part that i felt that could have been a little bit better i also had some questions about the incident at the parks outdoor birthday party regarding why something happened the way it did

the suspense really worked also outside of the mentioned scenes and the humor was usually landing the artsy shots and creative decisions all worked within the story this is a solid movie for 2019 and deserves the oscars",3.5,2020-02-14,imdb
"so just lemme give a short review about points that make parasite the best movie of the year or maybe the century

1 its a literal dark comedy movie although it discusses a non sensitive concept thats actually thrown every where on media

2 the economic gab wasnt about the evil rich or the fighting poors and has nothing with specific country u politicseconomy

3 the balance between reality and fiction that makes ur mind wonder instead of watching the same senario

"anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece is incredibly dimwitted ill be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast

1 infiltrating your entire family into the rich familys house

they say its hard to cover up one lie you know whats harder covering up a whole lot of them and thats what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly all 4 family members had to fake their identityqualifications pretending to not be related to one another when they are while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up the kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time

2 kevins best friend problem

your best friend has gave you an opportunity to earn some cash to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad he also tells you that hes coming back and will ask the richs family daughter out who he was tutoring he has specifically told you that hes interested in her he also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldnt

what do you think would happen when your best friend returns when he comes back to find out he has lost his job had his girl stolen right under his nose by his best friend and also finds out the best friend he confided in who has broken your utmost trust had his entire family infiltrated the rich mans family working under false pretenses

a is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you b expose you and your entire family

apparently kevin must have thought the answer must be a

anyone care to tell me the answer is b they would be exposed who would have thought about that right

i clearly remember the feeling when parasite ended the sense of having seen something different uncomfortable and at the same time strangely entertaining its not just that the film is original  which it is  but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing it starts almost like a game makes you lower your guard and before you realize it youre already deep into something much  of the great strengths of korean cinema and something thats especially evident here is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission black comedy social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here slowly creeping in nothing feels forced everything flows with a deceptive naturalness as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you  staging is key the use of space the contrasts between different worlds and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue theres an almost surgical precision in every visual decision but it never feels cold or calculated on the contrary everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary  the center of it all is bong joonhos gaze once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things whats interesting is that the film doesnt openly judge it observes lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and when it wants to presses exactly where it hurts most that mix of irony cruelty and clarity is what makes it so s not a film that ends when the credits roll it lingers making you rethink scenes gestures and decisions it has rhythm bite and intelligence and best of all it never loses its sense of spectaclei didnt find it perfect but very close to it one of those films that justify on their own why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen,4.5,2026-01-14,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling

parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship and with good reason its cinematography is carefully composed its symbolism is deliberately placed and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity a high level of directorial control is evident throughout and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence that said an emotional connection was difficult to establish the shifts in tone  though clearly intended  were experienced as uneven and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human which made empathy harder to sustain while the films artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey parasite may be admired for what it achieves but it was not personally found to be engaging in short worth watching hard to connect with,3.0,2025-07-05,metacritic

the script is equally impressive seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary the dialogue is razorsharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced with shocking twists that never feel contrived the way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to bongs exceptional storytelling skills

i clearly remember the feeling when parasite ended the sense of having seen something different uncomfortable and at the same time strangely entertaining its not just that the film is original  which it is  but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing it starts almost like a game makes you lower your guard and before you realize it youre already deep into something much  of the great strengths of korean cinema and something thats especially evident here is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission black comedy social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here slowly creeping in nothing feels forced everything flows with a deceptive naturalness as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you  staging is key the use of space the contrasts between different worlds and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue theres an almost surgical precision in every visual decision but it never feels cold or calculated on the contrary everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary  the center of it all is bong joonhos gaze once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things whats interesting is that the film doesnt openly judge it observes lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and when it wants to presses exactly where it hurts most that mix of irony cruelty and clarity is what makes it so s not a film that ends when the credits roll it lingers making you rethink scenes gestures and decisions it has rhythm bite and intelligence and best of all it never loses its sense of spectaclei didnt find it perfect but very close to it one of those films that justify on their own why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen,4.5,2026-01-14,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling
the screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion what begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller then a horror film without ever feeling disjointed the scripts genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions the dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently  each conversation serves multiple purposes advancing plot while developing relationships and themes

absolute bonkers of a film with the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror director bong joonho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative set designs cinematography and soundtracks which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story parasite 2019 is another great addition to bongs filmography although i do feel that it is one of his more accessible films i could not stop thinking about this film every day,5.0,2022-04-30,metacritic
i clearly remember the feeling when parasite ended the sense of having seen something different uncomfortable and at the same time strangely entertaining its not just that the film is original  which it is  but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing it starts almost like a game makes you lower your guard and before you realize it youre already deep into something much  of the great strengths of korean cinema and something thats especially evident here is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission black comedy social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here slowly creeping in nothing feels forced everything flows with a deceptive naturalness as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you  staging is key the use of space the contrasts between different worlds and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue theres an almost surgical precision in every visual decision but it never feels cold or calculated on the contrary everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary  the center of it all is bong joonhos gaze once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things whats interesting is that the film doesnt openly judge it observes lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and when it wants to presses exactly where it hurts most that mix of irony cruelty and clarity is what makes it so s not a film that ends when the credits roll it lingers making you rethink scenes gestures and decisions it has rhythm bite and intelligence and best of all it never loses its sense of spectaclei didnt find it perfect but very close to it one of those films that justify on their own why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen,4.5,2026-01-14,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling
the screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion what begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller then a horror film without ever feeling disjointed the scripts genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions the dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently  each conversation serves multiple purposes advancing plot while developing relationships and themes

overall impact
parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary it explores class inequality with nuance avoiding heavyhanded messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity the films universal themes transcend cultural boundaries making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly korean the pacing is expertly controlled building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion

parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship and with good reason its cinematography is carefully composed its symbolism is deliberately placed and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity a high level of directorial control is evident throughout and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence that said an emotional connection was difficult to establish the shifts in tone  though clearly intended  were experienced as uneven and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human which made empathy harder to sustain while the films artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey parasite may be admired for what it achieves but it was not personally found to be engaging in short worth watching hard to connect with,3.0,2025-07-05,metacritic

absolute bonkers of a film with the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror director bong joonho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative set designs cinematography and soundtracks which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story parasite 2019 is another great addition to bongs filmography although i do feel that it is one of his more accessible films i could not stop thinking about this film every day,5.0,2022-04-30,metacritic
i clearly remember the feeling when parasite ended the sense of having seen something different uncomfortable and at the same time strangely entertaining its not just that the film is original  which it is  but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing it starts almost like a game makes you lower your guard and before you realize it youre already deep into something much  of the great strengths of korean cinema and something thats especially evident here is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission black comedy social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here slowly creeping in nothing feels forced everything flows with a deceptive naturalness as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you  staging is key the use of space the contrasts between different worlds and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue theres an almost surgical precision in every visual decision but it never feels cold or calculated on the contrary everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary  the center of it all is bong joonhos gaze once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things whats interesting is that the film doesnt openly judge it observes lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and when it wants to presses exactly where it hurts most that mix of irony cruelty and clarity is what makes it so s not a film that ends when the credits roll it lingers making you rethink scenes gestures and decisions it has rhythm bite and intelligence and best of all it never loses its sense of spectaclei didnt find it perfect but very close to it one of those films that justify on their own why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen,4.5,2026-01-14,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling
the screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion what begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller then a horror film without ever feeling disjointed the scripts genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions the dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently  each conversation serves multiple purposes advancing plot while developing relationships and themes

overall impact
parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary it explores class inequality with nuance avoiding heavyhanded messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity the films universal themes transcend cultural boundaries making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly korean the pacing is expertly controlled building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion

parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship and with good reason its cinematography is carefully composed its symbolism is deliberately placed and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity a high level of directorial control is evident throughout and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence that said an emotional connection was difficult to establish the shifts in tone  though clearly intended  were experienced as uneven and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human which made empathy harder to sustain while the films artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey parasite may be admired for what it achieves but it was not personally found to be engaging in short worth watching hard to connect with,3.0,2025-07-05,metacritic

the script is equally impressive seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary the dialogue is razorsharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced with shocking twists that never feel contrived the way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to bongs exceptional storytelling skills

what elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms both families are sympathetic yet flawed making the inevitable collision all the more devastating i give it a perfect 1010  a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings",5.0,2025-05-04,metacritic

as a huge fan of snowpiercer i had incredibly high hopes for this film hopes that were far too high and far too unrealistic what the hell is this story and whats the pointparasite feels new fresh original all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim but where is it all goingits kind of an antihero tale this family is pulling off a multilayered clever con on this gullible innocent family and as the main characters youre kind of rooting for them or at least interested and invested in their story and where its  concept is not my favorite but it holds water as far as a plot goes however just as you are wrapping up at 200 and wondering where this plane is going to land the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst and now youre wondering what kind of film youre watching is this thriller is this horror is this drama is this mystery the plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right but lacking heart these genres dont quite all come  fact that this film won best picture at the 2019 oscars is baffling beyond mewhat little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless questioning purpose and the future not the kind experience im hoping for at the cinema,1.0,2025-03-08,metacritic

"a relatively simple lowkey racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy naïve white collar household

unpredictably composed parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between of the versatile tools in that particular box the films at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension i constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome not all of those nailbiters lead to fireworks and the film is careful not to overplay its hand so that when the time is right the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows

incendiary filmmaking  a watermark for modernday suspense that combines social commentary cringe comedy and nailbiting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented  the cast is terrific with song kangho park sodam and cho yeojeong all standing out as highlights  the script is razorsharp with every set piece and character decision leading to jawdropping results  the kim family is sympathetic but their actions often veer squarely into antihero territory  bong joonho is a master of his craft  there are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away  the pacing is perfect with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the kims actions comes to bear  run and see this one and get ready to be wowed,4.5,2024-08-28,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling
the screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion what begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller then a horror film without ever feeling disjointed the scripts genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions the dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently  each conversation serves multiple purposes advancing plot while developing relationships and themes

overall impact
parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary it explores class inequality with nuance avoiding heavyhanded messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity the films universal themes transcend cultural boundaries making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly korean the pacing is expertly controlled building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion

parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship and with good reason its cinematography is carefully composed its symbolism is deliberately placed and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity a high level of directorial control is evident throughout and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence that said an emotional connection was difficult to establish the shifts in tone  though clearly intended  were experienced as uneven and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human which made empathy harder to sustain while the films artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey parasite may be admired for what it achieves but it was not personally found to be engaging in short worth watching hard to connect with,3.0,2025-07-05,metacritic

parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship and with good reason its cinematography is carefully composed its symbolism is deliberately placed and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity a high level of directorial control is evident throughout and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence that said an emotional connection was difficult to establish the shifts in tone  though clearly intended  were experienced as uneven and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human which made empathy harder to sustain while the films artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey parasite may be admired for what it achieves but it was not personally found to be engaging in short worth watching hard to connect with,3.0,2025-07-05,metacritic

the script is equally impressive seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary the dialogue is razorsharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced with shocking twists that never feel contrived the way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to bongs exceptional storytelling skills

i clearly remember the feeling when parasite ended the sense of having seen something different uncomfortable and at the same time strangely entertaining its not just that the film is original  which it is  but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing it starts almost like a game makes you lower your guard and before you realize it youre already deep into something much  of the great strengths of korean cinema and something thats especially evident here is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission black comedy social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here slowly creeping in nothing feels forced everything flows with a deceptive naturalness as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you  staging is key the use of space the contrasts between different worlds and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue theres an almost surgical precision in every visual decision but it never feels cold or calculated on the contrary everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary  the center of it all is bong joonhos gaze once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things whats interesting is that the film doesnt openly judge it observes lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and when it wants to presses exactly where it hurts most that mix of irony cruelty and clarity is what makes it so s not a film that ends when the credits roll it lingers making you rethink scenes gestures and decisions it has rhythm bite and intelligence and best of all it never loses its sense of spectaclei didnt find it perfect but very close to it one of those films that justify on their own why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen,4.5,2026-01-14,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling
the screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion what begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller then a horror film without ever feeling disjointed the scripts genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions the dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently  each conversation serves multiple purposes advancing plot while developing relationships and themes

overall impact
parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary it explores class inequality with nuance avoiding heavyhanded messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity the films universal themes transcend cultural boundaries making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly korean the pacing is expertly controlled building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion

i clearly remember the feeling when parasite ended the sense of having seen something different uncomfortable and at the same time strangely entertaining its not just that the film is original  which it is  but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing it starts almost like a game makes you lower your guard and before you realize it youre already deep into something much  of the great strengths of korean cinema and something thats especially evident here is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission black comedy social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here slowly creeping in nothing feels forced everything flows with a deceptive naturalness as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you  staging is key the use of space the contrasts between different worlds and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue theres an almost surgical precision in every visual decision but it never feels cold or calculated on the contrary everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary  the center of it all is bong joonhos gaze once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things whats interesting is that the film doesnt openly judge it observes lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and when it wants to presses exactly where it hurts most that mix of irony cruelty and clarity is what makes it so s not a film that ends when the credits roll it lingers making you rethink scenes gestures and decisions it has rhythm bite and intelligence and best of all it never loses its sense of spectaclei didnt find it perfect but very close to it one of those films that justify on their own why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen,4.5,2026-01-14,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling
the screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion what begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller then a horror film without ever feeling disjointed the scripts genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions the dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently  each conversation serves multiple purposes advancing plot while developing relationships and themes

overall impact
parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary it explores class inequality with nuance avoiding heavyhanded messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity the films universal themes transcend cultural boundaries making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly korean the pacing is expertly controlled building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion

parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship and with good reason its cinematography is carefully composed its symbolism is deliberately placed and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity a high level of directorial control is evident throughout and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence that said an emotional connection was difficult to establish the shifts in tone  though clearly intended  were experienced as uneven and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human which made empathy harder to sustain while the films artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey parasite may be admired for what it achieves but it was not personally found to be engaging in short worth watching hard to connect with,3.0,2025-07-05,metacritic

even though the plot isnt really something different the way its developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great withs a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal and the vague glance of hope is shown at the end it has important subjects like the class division the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization,5.0,2022-05-02,metacritic

absolute bonkers of a film with the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror director bong joonho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative set designs cinematography and soundtracks which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story parasite 2019 is another great addition to bongs filmography although i do feel that it is one of his more accessible films i could not stop thinking about this film every day,5.0,2022-04-30,metacritic
i clearly remember the feeling when parasite ended the sense of having seen something different uncomfortable and at the same time strangely entertaining its not just that the film is original  which it is  but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing it starts almost like a game makes you lower your guard and before you realize it youre already deep into something much  of the great strengths of korean cinema and something thats especially evident here is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission black comedy social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here slowly creeping in nothing feels forced everything flows with a deceptive naturalness as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you  staging is key the use of space the contrasts between different worlds and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue theres an almost surgical precision in every visual decision but it never feels cold or calculated on the contrary everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary  the center of it all is bong joonhos gaze once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things whats interesting is that the film doesnt openly judge it observes lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and when it wants to presses exactly where it hurts most that mix of irony cruelty and clarity is what makes it so s not a film that ends when the credits roll it lingers making you rethink scenes gestures and decisions it has rhythm bite and intelligence and best of all it never loses its sense of spectaclei didnt find it perfect but very close to it one of those films that justify on their own why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen,4.5,2026-01-14,metacritic

"parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases bong joonhos exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance this film deserves every accolade it has received

directing  cinematography
bong joonhos direction is meticulous and purposeful every shot serves the narrative particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions  from the parks elevated mansion to the kims semibasement dwelling the camera movements are deliberate creating tension through simple pans and tilts the rain sequence is cinematographically stunning using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor the production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic

script  storytelling
the screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion what begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller then a horror film without ever feeling disjointed the scripts genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions the dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently  each conversation serves multiple purposes advancing plot while developing relationships and themes

overall impact
parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary it explores class inequality with nuance avoiding heavyhanded messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity the films universal themes transcend cultural boundaries making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly korean the pacing is expertly controlled building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion

parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship and with good reason its cinematography is carefully composed its symbolism is deliberately placed and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity a high level of directorial control is evident throughout and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence that said an emotional connection was difficult to establish the shifts in tone  though clearly intended  were experienced as uneven and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human which made empathy harder to sustain while the films artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey parasite may be admired for what it achieves but it was not personally found to be engaging in short worth watching hard to connect with,3.0,2025-07-05,metacritic

parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting bong joon hos direction is meticulous using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes the script is brilliantly layered seamlessly blending dark comedy thriller and social commentary the dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thoughtprovoking,5.0,2025-05-13,metacritic
"bong joon hos masterpiece parasite deserves every accolade it has received the directing is absolutely flawless with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the films themes of social inequality the way bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant  from the cramped semibasement of the kim family to the architectural marvel of the park residence 

the script is equally impressive seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary the dialogue is razorsharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced with shocking twists that never feel contrived the way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to bongs exceptional storytelling skills

what elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms both families are sympathetic yet flawed making the inevitable collision all the more devastating i give it a perfect 1010  a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings",5.0,2025-05-04,metacritic

as a huge fan of snowpiercer i had incredibly high hopes for this film hopes that were far too high and far too unrealistic what the hell is this story and whats the pointparasite feels new fresh original all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim but where is it all goingits kind of an antihero tale this family is pulling off a multilayered clever con on this gullible innocent family and as the main characters youre kind of rooting for them or at least interested and invested in their story and where its  concept is not my favorite but it holds water as far as a plot goes however just as you are wrapping up at 200 and wondering where this plane is going to land the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst and now youre wondering what kind of film youre watching is this thriller is this horror is this drama is this mystery the plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right but lacking heart these genres dont quite all come  fact that this film won best picture at the 2019 oscars is baffling beyond mewhat little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless questioning purpose and the future not the kind experience im hoping for at the cinema,1.0,2025-03-08,metacritic

"a relatively simple lowkey racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy naïve white collar household

unpredictably composed parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between of the versatile tools in that particular box the films at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension i constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome not all of those nailbiters lead to fireworks and the film is careful not to overplay its hand so that when the time is right the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows

incendiary filmmaking  a watermark for modernday suspense that combines social commentary cringe comedy and nailbiting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented  the cast is terrific with song kangho park sodam and cho yeojeong all standing out as highlights  the script is razorsharp with every set piece and character decision leading to jawdropping results  the kim family is sympathetic but their actions often veer squarely into antihero territory  bong joonho is a master of his craft  there are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away  the pacing is perfect with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the kims actions comes to bear  run and see this one and get ready to be wowed,4.5,2024-08-28,metacritic

parasite leaves you with the feeling of having seen something truly different it starts almost like a game lowers your guard and gradually pulls you into something far darker one of its greatest strengths is how effortlessly it blends tones black comedy social satire and rising tension coexist without ever feeling forced the films use of space and visual contrasts adds as much meaning as the dialogue giving every scene a precise but never cold clarity bong joonho observes rather than judges letting the story speak for itself while pressing exactly where it hurts most its smart sharp uncomfortable and deeply entertaining not quite perfect but very close,4.5,2026-01-15,rottentomatoes

this movie doesnt have a great plot when you think about it the filmography is great the acting is good enough but if you lifted the plot of this movie out of the trappings of its high production value it stands to reason you would be bored out of your mind it sort of makes me think it was written as a comedy initially and then someone just wanted to change the ending lets simplify lets say woo is our main character does he learn anything does he change in anyway is he less likely to be a fraudster in the future nope not really and all of the nonsense with the former maid none of it actually changes the story if you replace the husband of the maid with any random person the movie would fundamentally not change there are plenty of people within the story the driver the mother a the pissing homeless person  who could take the place and the movie would be the same just another high production movie that demands praise for blowing money,1.0,2025-12-15,rottentomatoes

bong joonhos parasite represents a paradigmatic breakthrough in contemporary global cinema an incisive exploration of class capitalism and human duplicity rendered with both stylistic audacity and narrative precision the films meticulous miseenscène transforms the domestic sphere into a symbolic theater of socioeconomic tension where architectural design spatial hierarchy and visual composition become instruments of storytelling as potent as dialogue each performance from the parasitic kim family to the oblivious parks oscillates between caricature and startling verisimilitude sustaining a tonal dexterity that shifts seamlessly between dark comedy suspense and moral horror bongs screenplay interrogates systemic inequality with surgical wit exposing the grotesque absurdities and inevitable tragedies that emerge from entrenched social stratification parasite is not merely a cinematic triumph it is an intellectual and aesthetic reckoning a work in which the personal and political the grotesque and the elegiac coalesce into a singularly compelling meditation on the human conditiona film that justifiably reshaped the international cinematic landscape,5.0,2025-11-12,rottentomatoes
from the darkly comic to the deeply tragic parasite has everything designed as a masterful combination of drama thriller and black comedy it tells the story of two families from completely opposite worlds  one poor one rich  whose lives intertwine in unpredictable and unsettling ways if youre looking for something intense thoughtprovoking and unforgettable its definitely worth seeing this film as a movie fan myself i was really delighted to watch such a fascinating mix of humor and suspense the first thing that caught my eye was the films perfect balance between realism and symbolism initially i thought it was simply satire ridiculing the big gap in social inequality but actually it turns into a gripping psychological thriller that keeps you guessing among all the elements of the film there are some truly intelligent ideas too like how the director shows social inequality and moral corruption through space and architecture my personal favourite the shocking twist halfway through the film  brilliant and haunting if you like movies that combine strong storytelling with sharp social commentary and creepy moments parasite is an absolute mustsee,5.0,2025-11-10,rottentomatoes

an entertaining black comedy yet with a less plausible plot where a whole family just too easily goes from folding pizza boxes to completely taking over a wealthy household,3.5,2025-08-25,rottentomatoes
not much to say its just good,4.5,2025-08-23,rottentomatoes
spoiler alert ill start by saying that this film is intelligently written it was a hilarious black comedy and was well on its way to being a masterpiece in my eyes and then came the final act it went from black comedy to full dark tragedy with an ending that was all over the place ill admit this picture is too wellmade to not be considered a great film but it deserved a proper ending something definitive this ending just did not work for me it was certainly strange but not in a good way it was not boring ill say that it just lacked a proper resolution in my humble opinion this movie could have ended in a number of ways and still would have been a masterpiece but the way it ended seemed more like a collage of unfinished ideas no matter how i feel about the storys end i most definitely recommend this one 92100,4.5,2025-08-23,rottentomatoes

i am baffled why this movie was given so much attention i couldnt even get past the first 35 minutes which were very slow going i had absolutely zero emotional investment in the characters when i look at audience reviews on this and other platforms they seem overthetop to the extent that it makes me wonder who was paid off and how nothing against the actors or the direction its just that there are so much better films,0.5,2025-07-07,rottentomatoes

ok i was skeptical that a foreign film won best movie oscar this movie weird but in a super cool way almost like a david lynch type film ultimately its a very sad movie ive seen other korean films and though they usually are ok they dont compare to american movies this one just based on its originality and story deserves the 5 stars i dont give many that the acting was good and not too hokey which korean acting can be at times the dialogue was good some of it funny and its nicely directed and shot korea is now what america will be in 50 years poverty and suffering so a few people can have everything they want im gonna ruminate over this today and its obviously going to stay in my collection great film,5.0,2025-06-17,rottentomatoes

its a bit overrated but 200k people seem to think this movie was the best movie of the 21st century ive watched a lot of korean revenge movies and this was probably not at the top however for awards purposes i can see why it is ranked so high korean moviesshows were never really publicized until recently look at squid game the reason it got global publicity was because of netflix without netflix it never would have gotten so much fame,4.5,2025-04-18,rottentomatoes
all time classic the editing and pacing are masterful it reminds me of something that hitchcock or even the coen brothers would make its extremely witty has really good dark humor and has tons of underlying commentary about poverty and a two class society and the different human expierence by each and how those worlds collide its an extremely intelligent thiller the cinematography is first rate as well the shots inside the house deep focus lighting and direction are all just masterful everything else is really good never really seen something like this everyone should should give this a try once,5.0,2025-04-18,rottentomatoes

hey i just wanted to give you a headsup that this review might contain some spoilers for the movie parasite the movie starts with the story of the main characters family they live in a small basement room and arent very healthy they make a living by folding pizza boxes which isnt a very wellpaying job their financial struggles are so big that they turn to public insecticides administered via wifi and have to use them inshared spacesmoney problems also mean that they cant go to collegebut then the protagonist meets someone who helps him and his family move in with a rich person his initial job as an english tutor where he gained his teaching credentials was followed by his rise to a professional position as an art instructor a role that also required him to get his teaching credentials since his sister who was also his art instructor didnt have much moneydespite the lack of financial resources the heros creativity and methods won over the mother and childits heartwarming to see how he found his way to become a loving art instructor then the father allowed him to become a driver which he did with a clever plan the film is full of moments that shed light on classism like when the rich mother hits the car seat with her foot or when the rich father pretends to smell the heros fathertheres also a conversation between the rich husband and wife about the drivers body odor drug trafficking and underwear in the car that looks insulted it all builds up to a point where the heros father feels so insulted that he has to stab the rich father to death thoughts from this movie in our world people who dont have a lot of money often have to work really hard to take care of themselves its more important for them to think about themselves than to think about other people even when we plan everything life doesnt always go as wed hoped as the heros father learned the hard way,4.0,2025-03-24,rottentomatoes

love a film that respects its audience there are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats there are a lot of layers to this film and i suspect for this reason its rewatchability factor will be very high,5.0,2025-02-12,rottentomatoes
i believe it is wonderful how the director is able to transform a seemingly normal beggining into a tenseful film that catches your attention fully i also must applause the form the movie uses unharmful scenes to do so in a way that little by little you understand the feeling of complete tiredoom from the poorer family absolutily unsettling and extraordinarius,5.0,2025-02-11,rottentomatoes
third act was rough just like every osgood perkins movie but this one has something the others dont which is incredibly gory deaths and impeccable comedic timing,5.0,2025-02-11,rottentomatoes
i was advised to watch this without learning anything about it thats what i did no summary no trailers i only knew it won best picture so my expectations were high unfortunately i was let down big time i expect to care about characters i did not care about these there was no one to root for no hero no attachment at all it was like watching your neighbors life that you couldnt care less about drag on and on until you realize in this case that the twist and resolution was not meaningful either as if the writer needed a conclusion and asked around for the most ridiculous ideas then simply chose one and wrote it in one review characterized this film as vapid and i fully agree a good movie will at least move me emotionally in some way this didnt do that either,1.5,2025-02-11,rottentomatoes

in the year 2019 it has been a very busy year for films that actually have a seal of approval of films ive watched at that year some of which i havent reviewed apart from three of them such as little women the gentlemen joker the irishman marriage story uncut gems toy story 4 once upon a time in hollywood john wick chapter 3  parabellum and avengers endgame now we have a film which is a foreign film that many people including myself really really love and well cherish it forever in years to come and that foreign film is got to be parasite yes parasite one of most anticipated films of all time and one of the memorable ones out there many people had difficulty watching it without knowing what theyre saying but the subtitles can help them understand and since that this is another foreign film i reviewed i think i should be doing more if i had the chance the kim family lives in a semibasement flat banjiha in seoul have lowincome jobs and struggle for money as theyre all unemployed minhyuk a family friend gives the family a scholars rock meant to promise wealth leaving to study abroad he suggests that the kims son kiwoo lie about his education to take over his job as an english language tutor for dahye the daughter of the rich but naïve park family after his sister kijung helps create a false certificate for him in photoshop kiwoo posing as a yonsei university student is hired by the parks moments later kims family takes peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous parks for their livelihood until something goes wrong,5.0,2025-01-30,rottentomatoes
there are just a few directors that have accomplished such a complex and unique combination of feelings genres and twists all of these in one movie bong joonho did it and he did it great its a movie about capitalism about that intrinsic sense of belonging and owning in societies so different but so alike at the same time the chemistry and behavior between the characters and their plans will keep you on the edge of your seat you will ask yourself through the whole movie who is the parasite of the story a closer look at a family living in some unfortunate conditions and the contrast with the upper class and how far will they go to have whatever they think they need to be happy,5.0,2025-01-29,rottentomatoes

a masterful movie in every way,5.0,2025-01-23,rottentomatoes
the ending is effective but im not sure it says much other than that the disparities between rich and poor are senseless that they breed mutual enmity out of resentment and indignation or a sense of effete supercillious perogative its layered sure its also well executed and in its own way incisive but honestly i dont think its ultimately saying anything a reasonably intelligent person with enough life experience hasnt figured out for themselves already or maybe ive just been poor for too long are you stinking rich well good for you watch parasite or dont no one will care least of all you either way are you poor well you probably wont be overly impressed are you middleclass well no one cares for your opinions of this film excepting other middle class folk of course so have at it,3.5,2025-01-23,rottentomatoes
parasite isnt the grand treatise on class disparity that people have made it out to be but its a great thriller thats just ridiculous enough to keep from being too depressing,4.0,2025-01-18,rottentomatoes
an amazing dark comedy thriller that seamlessly blends clever satire and dreadful tension about class divide and how it forces otherwise good people into a fight for survival by any means necessary despite the subtitles i was so engrossed by the almosthypnotic visual storytelling the easily relatable identifiable performances and the pageturner narrative that constantly keeps you on your toes with not knowing where the storys going yet continuously building upon itself with amazingly brisk pacing despite its 2 hour runtime i love how theres so many layers to the themes and even whos the real titular parasite given all the individual actions vs the root systematic cause of their actions its also just genuinely hilarious despite the dark turn it takes but even that dark turn feels naturally woven into the narrative without feeling like cheap scares for shock value its an amazing cinematic experience and easily one of my favorite movies of 2019,5.0,2025-01-17,rottentomatoes

i just finished watching the film the first thing i need to say shouldnt be about the film itself but rather about the feelings within me right after it i am sure many of you might know the painful feeling of emptiness one might experience if ones favorite series with characters and a story you had the chance to bond to over an extensive amount of time and many episodes and seasons comes to an end you just feel without a clear goal it feels like a good friend has died ok maybe not that bad and you need to learn what to do with yourself again after having got used to spending all your time with himher this was the first movie that made me feel this way you might say that feeling like this might sound like a terrible thing and in some way it is but if i personally deeply think about it i would object this feeling is a wonderful testiment of how great a movie was able to touch the viewers emotion and soul in a weird philosophical way it is proof of the true humanity of everybody that feels it i dont think this movies brilliance can be boiled down or be dissected in individual parts like cinematography characters or story it is the great sum of all those parts that creates the true brilliance being the feelings it awakens in its viewers it perfectly mirrors an each and every humans being in a way this is why you might feel a rush of those described negative emotions but if you think about it and feel really deep within yourselfit also awakens the feeling of being understood and a part of a greater lonelinessexpelling community of beings that are in some or another way connected by interest or emotion and therefore possess the ability to archieve wonderful and amazing feats such as creating this movie,5.0,2024-11-03,rottentomatoes

this movie was intense beautifully filmed and welldepicted lessons on greed from many perspectives you can see the tarantinoesc way about this film but ultimately this film was its own thing the framing and the simplicity of dialogue and vision were powerful though the violence and this type of intensity sometimes arent my favorite still this movie had such awe about it it made sense that it got a movie of the year it drew you in for me theres no need to see it twice but glad i saw it once,4.0,2024-10-17,rottentomatoes

i dont get the exaggerated hype sure this is one unpredictable plot with great cinematography and performances sprinkled with an entrancing soundtrack that makes it far from perfect nonetheless the first part is tedious and seems elongated while the second part is not that different except for a slightlyrushed infamous scene as a whole parasite is peculiar but also somewhat pretentious and this has nothing to do with the portrayal of a snobbish bunch but rather with the way through which this snobbyneedy juxtaposition is dealt with in a world of extremes where the ratings for this movie are either 5 stars or just half a star i choose to take the rocky path and declare the following this isnt a movie one would find oneself itching to watch again any time soon but it also isnt one short of standing beside the classics,3.0,2024-09-11,rottentomatoes

for me this movie did not live up to the hype how were the parks the rich upperclass family responsible for any of the madness that ensues when they come into contact with despicable kims the critics think that this film brilliantly explores the nuances between opposite social classes i think it was all just rather vapid and pointless,2.5,2024-06-20,rottentomatoes
glad to see a foreign film get nominated and win even though they have their own category im fairly familiar with korean drama but for the virgin kdrama viewer this may have seemed cheesy i enjoyed the film aside from that slight cheesiness that is common in korean filmtelevision it was darker that typical korean fare and the ending was bizarre this wouldnt have been my pick for best picture too many other great choices this year,3.0,2024-06-18,rottentomatoes

i understand the movie refers to the social gap i really do but for someone whos already aware of this the plot makes much ado about nothing sure theres a little suspense with the basement but thats about it i truly did not see the hype on this movie as a movie buff as well i watched it in all subtitles but i dont think thats what killed the experience for me the plot felt nonsensical or rather inconsequential the script didnt have any standouts the character relationships or other character tropes werent anything special the only interesting point was seeing how rich people arent really aware of their riches or how other people might look at them  strive to be like them is that truly indicative of a bigger scale or just a piece of these characters who knows,2.5,2024-05-06,rottentomatoes

parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force a searing indictment of the socioeconomic disparities entrenched within korean society director bong joonho masterfully crafts a narrative that pulsates with tension expertly weaving together themes of class struggle and human desperation the films chaotic energy is palpable from start to finish ensnaring viewers in its gripping tale of deceit and survival at its core parasite presents a scathing critique of the cavernous divide between the haves and the havenots as the destitute kim family infiltrates the affluent park household through a web of deception each twist and turn in the plot serves to intensify the films relentless momentum leaving audiences on the edge of their seats as they grapple with the moral ambiguities laid bare before them what truly sets parasite apart is its ability to provoke introspection long after the credits have rolled the films rich tapestry of characters and layered narrative demand multiple viewings each unveiling new depths to explore and dissect bong joonhos directorial prowess shines brightly infusing every frame with a sense of urgency and unease that lingers in the mind in the end parasite transcends the confines of its genre emerging as a profound meditation on the human condition and the corrosive effects of inequality it is a cinematic experience that demands to be rewatched its impact only deepening with each subsequent viewing in a landscape inundated with mediocrity parasite stands as a beacon of artistic excellencea film that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on cinema for years to come,4.5,2024-04-17,rottentomatoes

theres nothing about parasite that hasnt already been said it truly is an amazing piece of work and deserves all the praise it gets plenty of other films have expressed the same social criticisms but its the exploration of human desperation with extreme authenticity and realism that is so haunting its disturbing yet brilliant and is what really makes standout it exposes the inequalities between social classes and how it brings out the worst in everyone,5.0,2024-03-20,rottentomatoes

it begins with a family of four from the lower class in korean society a father mother eldest son and younger sister both parents are unemployed and the children did not continue their education they all lived in a basement room but then suddenly it was like heaven had given a big blessing to this family when the eldest brothers friend has to study abroad so he entrusted him to teach english to a rich mans daughter however this apparent stroke of luck eventually leads to unforeseen disaster and this is the first movie in 92 years of the oscars to be the winner of this award it is a nonenglishlanguage film its undeniable this movie is famous and popularity because of the outstanding cinematography and unforgettable characters first of all i will talk about the best scenes that impressed and fascinated me while watching this movie the scene of walking down the stairs to return to the mouse hole home while it rains occurs after the parasitic family has to escape from the paradise they have only recently enjoyed the kim family ran home to save as much of their belongings as possible after watching that scene made me feel like it reflects society that rich people are at a high point and can take the heart of a crisis but poor people must overcome their own obstacles then during the conversation with the lady during a phone call she talked about something that made kim ki taek stop this is another scene that makes me feel that no matter what class or society you belong to you will be criticized looked down on oppressed and cynical by someone higher than you anyway while all the actors in the film deserve praise for their performances kim ki taeks character portrayed by song kang ho stands out of the narrative i really love him because he is the main characters that makes the story fun hilarious tense and thrilling at the same time he made the story colorful and not too stressful,4.5,2024-03-09,rottentomatoes

melhor filme que já foi feito já história da humanidade até os dias de hoje,5.0,2024-02-23,rottentomatoes
although vastly overrated 기생충 starts with a very creative idea supported by lovable performances unfortunately it soon falls apart due to the korean adagium that some super unrealistic thing absolutely must happen to keep a movie from being boring and as soon as the film takes that turn theres really nowhere for it to go but an uninspired conclusion,3.5,2024-02-18,rottentomatoes
the acting in this movie is acceptable and we accept all the characters but in terms of structure narrative miseenscène and framing this movie is very good i think the director knows what he wants and knows how to show it and this is the art of directing,4.5,2024-01-31,rottentomatoes

after you watch this film ask yourself who the titular parasite is as a lowerclass family integrates themselves with an upper class family the lies and deceit begin to bite them back as they discover something that throws everything into disarray bringing up themes of class and high society this is a film thatll leave you shocked and very unnerved,5.0,2024-01-17,rottentomatoes

this film is absolutely thrilling engaging and contains elements that will grip you throughout its entirety however i think there are far better movies from south korea that i myself have seen recently such as a moment to remember  past lives they might not be of the same genre but the previously stated films mainly a moment to remember deserves to be equally acclaimed of not more despite lacking thrilling aspects which most of the time is what forces us to be glued on our sofa expecting every upcoming moments these movies rely on romance interesting stories and subtly reveal concepts that we rarely stumble upon on most movies and series being released these days the actors are impeccably competent the excellency of the cinematography is unimaginable and the sets display visually appealing areas of the asian continent this is an area that i think parasite must have capitalized on gladly they saved the whole thing with twists and turns mainly one that makes the 2h12 worth your time,3.5,2023-12-20,rottentomatoes
saw this in the theater when it came out and then saw it again two days ago excellent portrait of rich and poor and as always with korean cinema the innate flaws of humanity and pitfalls of an infinitely imperfect universe sometimes the morally superior position is unoccupied because given the tools the characters have been assigned in life the morally superior position is exceedingly difficult to compute andor attain,4.5,2023-12-08,rottentomatoes

a fresh and original story that moves along at a steady and wellbalanced pace with more than a couple surprises along the way,4.0,2023-06-27,rottentomatoes
this is s very good movie what makes it so is it presents very complex relationships in a simplified limited sets environment there is an intimacy to the proceedings and this augments the comedic aspect as well the acting is efficient and effective the one drawback is the two dimensional characters presented as absolute versions of rich and poor in other words youre either on this side or that side that is not to say that there are not people that act and think this way it all seems very convenient and you can predict character reactions there is no warmth or sympathy between the families no personal connections with everyone being disposable and blind to one another they pursue their own self interests without ethics or morality either a hustler or very gullible however as a black comedy this can work and it does so throughout the movie it is a movie that must be thought about considering each layer like matryoshka dolls class interactions causing intraclass dichotomies and violence a very harsh movie on its own characters i have watched it more than once i pick up something new or a new idea about the film with each viewing exactly the effect a thinking movie should have on its audience,3.5,2023-06-18,rottentomatoes

the first half of the film is darkly humorous with a family living in a basement lying and framing the driver and housekeeper in an effort to work for the rich when i saw the first half i thought it was supposed to be a comedy until they see rich people go camping but the jin family actually live in the mansion eat and drink and completely consider themselves rich it makes me uncomfortable to see this because it is greed they want to make money thats normal but to enjoy a life of utter hypocrisy is greed seeing the heavy rain i thought the host family would come back the good part of the movie is the return of the old butler the turning point of the film is the scene leading to the basement from this moment on this is no longer a comedy it became a conspiracy a bigger lie a fight for life i thought that the jin family has parasitic in the rich family did not think that the old housekeeper and her husband is a bigger parasite after watching this movie i always wonder what i would have done if i was living in a basement working for a rich man i will definitely work hard to make money change a better house and then through this job to find a better job for myself that should be most peoples plan the jin family although very smart also very good at work but they are lazy do not make progress do not have a plan and do not seek to change the status quo so they would rather be parasites and feel inferior than change the status quo the lesson of this film is that if you are not satisfied with your life you must find a way to improve the quality of your life because you can,5.0,2023-06-08,rottentomatoes
it was entertaining but not mindblowingly good as many western critics indicated part of the confusion is caused by western critics who seem to be evaluating the plots shock value based on a europeanwestern 3act structure instead of the 4act asian structure this movie plot follows the latter and is consistent with the timing and expected twists and turns of that structure after accounting for the 4act structure this plot is not as shocking or surprising as western critics seem to think instead it takes the expected twists  turns in the expected order which reduces its shock value still its an entertaining way to pass a few hours,3.0,2023-06-01,rottentomatoes

overrated is the operative word this is a year that gave us once upon a time in hollywood 1917 jojo rabbit all of which i believe were far stronger accomplishments regardless of that this is a good film at times very good but theres nothing that merits the hoopla other than a foreign film being the the esoteric darling of that years hollywood cultural mentality about cultural mentalities parasite isnt worth vaccinating against but its overactive accolades were a bit pestilential,3.5,2023-04-01,rottentomatoes

if any creation is able to make an unforgettable imprint of what needs changing in this world that production has fully achieved its purpose through precise acting by the cast the movie imposingly justifies the desperation of the neglected a well written story with imaginativeness of the highest quality excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the societys core excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities theres alot to gather from this movie and whats truly interesting when its viewers turn to decide who the real parasites of the society are,5.0,2023-03-06,rottentomatoes

a tedious mediocrity for a so called masterpiece parasite is one of those movies you go into expecting a walk on the red carpet experience especially for a critic apprentice like me none of over sort happened and snacks were not provided so i had to begrudgingly hark over 20 for a popcorn surely this couldnt get any worse but as the light went dim and the projector starting whirling i stared in pure baffling awe as the movie wasnt even in english no seriously who would have left such a grave technical error in the final product i had to squint and read the tiny text at the bottom surely damped my mood this movie was only made to hate on rich people which is insensitive because they are only using the fruits of their labor to live their everyday lives i find it ironic that these top critics shower this movie with praise when they themselves are money hungry worms how upsetting,2.0,2022-10-28,rottentomatoes

director bong joon ho has always been preoccupied with socioeconomic disparity but he takes it to an entirely different level with parasite when the impoverished kim family cleverly inserts itself into the wealthy park family life for both families spirals out of control resulting in unimaginable chaos and horror parasite is a film truly unlike any other an ingeniously plotted nightmare that works as both an art film and entertainment for the masses bong joon ho a master of visuals frames and blocks every shot meticulously humor is perfectly balanced with suspense all while remaining faithful to his theme parasite is one of the best films of the 21st century if not the best,5.0,2022-10-11,rottentomatoes

a very good but not absolutely incredible movie uses symbolism the most very well very good storytelling through visuals,4.5,2022-09-06,rottentomatoes
among movies that will be in the running for the oscars 2020 the most interesting is the achievement of korean director bong joonhu not because of some special quality and originality but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of korean films nor was he ever interested in being one on the other hand bong joonhu became an international creator with his excellent snowpiercer from 2013 so the criteria should be in line with that fact the film is at first indisputably interesting to watch drinkable extraordinarily driven it is placed between comedy drama and thriller intelligently refusing to classify itself as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible it will undoubtedly be awarded with some oscars except for acting because there is no reason for that but there is also no reason to emphasize the overoriginality of the story itself ie screenplay because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 french director and screenwriter rene clements joy house aka the cage of love with alain delon and jane fonda the main thrust of joonhus film is taken from the title with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere which of course is so modern today but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons also in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot communicating with the morse code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre,2.5,2022-09-05,rottentomatoes
shocking to see so many korean actors in a korean film of course wheres your diversity  the film was very good with interesting social commentary but i did find it a little absurd in places and the ending wasnt for me,4.5,2022-09-03,rottentomatoes
this is a tense and somewhat unsettling film which is thrilling and claustrophobic at times its certainly a multilayered plot that builds up slowly i wouldnt want to say anymore so as not to provide any potential spoilers its not clear from the start whats going to happen and its a film thats likely enjoyed more if you dont have too many preconceptions its certainly quite a memorable film i wouldnt say its the most thought provoking film ive ever seen by any means but it is pretty thoughtful in terms of the general societal themes covered i would certainly recommend it if your keen on world cinema and like to watch films that keep you guessing,4.5,2022-09-02,rottentomatoes
der film ist eine mischung von schauspiel thriller gleichnis posse karikatur und komödie und spielt das soziale ungleichgewicht in südkorea und sogleich der welt an bong joonho schrieb das drehbuch mit han jinwon und sogleich führte auch bong joonho die regie der film ist perfekt inszeniert er ist mit spürbarer liebe ausgestattet und mit können gestaltet selbst die filmmusik ist mit modernen und klassischen elementen bestückt für mich ist der film mit seinen darstellern in aller hinsicht perfekt und des lobes würdig ein genuss für die augen und für die ohren,5.0,2022-08-29,rottentomatoes

one of the best movies ive ever seen,5.0,2022-08-15,rottentomatoes
a haunting pitch black comedy that thoroughly skewers the dog eat dog world of capitalism it leaves you feeling lost in the fog of who the real parasite is the poor who must violently contend against each other and fight dirty for a chance to suckle off the teat of the rich or the rich who are infantilized by their own wealth into a selfish helplessness on which they survive off the labors of those they keep in destitution the twists kept me on the edge of my seat while the dark humor rubbed salt in my wounds all of this brings you to an ending so bleak it highlights the faults in a system where the only way to live is without direction as any plan is folly in the face of where you are born under capitalism,5.0,2022-08-15,rottentomatoes
parasite is like a boeing 777 taking off vertically soaring high losing velocity and falling to earth in a raging fireball in other words ive seldom been so impressed by the first 3 acts of a movie or so let down by the last 2 what makes the movie initially so charming is the crisp fairytale structure of the plot offering glimmers of hope that maybe just maybe filmmakers have rediscovered the art of storytelling the kim familys takeover of a palatial hillside home or at least the downstairs bit is a joy to behold it follows relentless patterns of connivance and insinuation as when the old housekeeper is let go for seeming to stain a handkerchief with tubercular blood no problem mrs kim with a helpful reference from a daughter posing as an art therapist is right on hand to fill the spot despite the folktale vibe theres plenty of nuance too we are not invited to simply pity the destitute kims or to despise the complacent parks somewhere midway through mr kim shares his lifes store of wisdom with his son planning things out is a waste of time and whatever happens happens what can you do with such a patriarch its not hard to see how the kims have made themselves desperately poor equally reprehensible is the kims outlook toward the parks whom they dehumanize as gullible marks meanwhile the parks are presented as clean organized and essentially decent mrs park despite her emotional imbalance is particularly winsome and you flinch when the kims call her an idiot behind her back unfortunately all of this nuance is lost by the end other reviews have pointed out the richly metaphorical nature of the movie but i would add that the metaphors fall like a rain of bricks in seeing mr kim hired as a chauffeur forced to don an indian headdress for a birthday party we are to associate him with the oppressed peoples of the world,1.5,2022-08-14,rottentomatoes

the overall high level of quality is very apparent the movie is excellently staged shot and directed the story also moves at a very efficient pace its fast but every scene adds to the story and it slows down when it needs to parasite is truly gripping partially due to its structure and it uses both humor and tension expertly the films message is clearly conveyed not only through the characters and their actions but also very much through the cinematography there are some nice dichotomies that separate rich and poor  light and dark clean and dirty and high and low,5.0,2022-08-03,rottentomatoes

la película perfecta para cerrar la década esta joya de suspenso y comedia negra surcoreana dirigida por el casi visionario bong joonho es más que solo la mejor película de 2019 es un fenómeno sensacional de la industria saltando de un género al otro parasite 2019 realmente sorprende con su inteligente humor reflexión ante los temas de interacciones y clases sociales y dándole una vuelta de tuerca a la trama un par de veces las emociones de la película adoptan nuevos grados de intensidad por minuto el pulso cardiaco también apoyando todos los géneros que representa así como paralelamente los temas preocupantes que hay en su escena sus numerosas nominaciones a los óscar aseguran su título como futuro clásico principalmente por el logro de ser la primera película de idioma no ingles que gana el premio a mejor película este es un tipo bienvenido de parásito que no se va de mi cabeza y creo que muchas personas que la vieron van a estar de acuerdo al respecto,5.0,2022-06-28,rottentomatoes

parasite is a visually and emotionally stunning experience like no other film and undeniably meets all the criteria in order to be called a masterpiece having won many awards at the 92nd academy awards like best international feature film this movie is an absolute gem because of its acting cinematography and its relatability based in korea the greatest deceitful scheme yet of the kim family begins to unravel in many unexpecting ways that leave the audience stunned parasite offers a wide range of talented actors that advanced the story overall creating such believable families the cinematography is awardwinning that helps support the main theme through the use of its unbelievable camera angles and lighting its ability to relate to the audience is what truly grants this film a mustwatch alongside its technical aspects its an insightful look into the universal idea of inequality among different classes of people that generally affects everyone globally all these fundamental elements artfully woven together give the impression of an entirely new movie experience which makes it stand above the rest,5.0,2022-04-07,rottentomatoes

entertaining dark scatterbrain comedy that goes off waaay into the weeds at the 34 mark works makes sense  you root for the kims  until the bizarre events of toward the end those choices seem somewhat contrived and out of character for characters that have repeatedly demonstrated themselves as bright and capable of passing for hardworking smarterthaneveryoneelse competent people for extended periods of time to get and keep their target jobs truthfully though this dichotomy does create a substantial mismatch with the early depiction of them as substantially lazy intoxicated underachievers that cant consistently even fold boxes with any consistency who suddenly and miraculously pull smart choices and superspylevel skills and talents out of seeming nowhere i think it misses somewhat in the capitalism is the problem angle widely pitched as the kims are clearly very capable and motivated and can achieve amazing things when they apply themselves but seem to have arrived at their semibasement apartment  and their lifestyle of sitting around folding pizza boxes  through utter lack of motivation and rampant inertia recommended just not as satisfying as id hoped,3.5,2022-02-27,rottentomatoes

disturbing thats the first word that comes to mind i appreciate disturbing movies when they teach me something or make me reflect but honestly i dont get why so much fuss about this one i see the point about it highlighting the inequalities between rich and poor people and the fact that poor people would go to some length to improve their status but i didnt find that there was anything deeper than that perhaps some of the images slightly symbolical ie poor people living in the basement below the rich and the familys dad killing a bug ie parasite at the start but thats the easiest kind of symbols one can come up with i totally dont get the fuss what am i missing,2.0,2022-01-14,rottentomatoes

south korea has an answer for m night shyamalan that answer is bong joonho bong joonho and his masterpiece parasite has so much nuance moments in the film especially with the tone shifts what i loved the most about the tone shift in this film was when the doorbell rang the main characters get into deeper trouble then they thought with a hint of a twist the music is beautiful the writing is brilliant and the intense scenes during the climax are just miraculous parasite is such an extraordinary that will be talked about for years to come,5.0,2021-11-30,rottentomatoes

too little can be added to talk about this film so ill just reaffirm what weve heard millions of times parasite is a masterpiece wih no comparison,5.0,2021-11-25,rottentomatoes
warning spoilers its possible that i watched this movie with my expectations too high the way most critics wrote about this movie i was literally expecting something mind blowing well it wasgood the first hour or so was really barely okay this involved the poor family infiltrating the rich family by taking over the servants jobs honestly i normally wouldnt have made it through that first hour but surely something mind blowing was coming right well not really the rest of the movie was quite gripping at times i really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family that was avery powerful scene so add up a barely mediocre first half with a really good but not great second half and i dont get it is there something im missing here,3.5,2021-11-21,rottentomatoes

while it was good i didnt find it incredible enough to win the academy award the last half hour or so was uninteresting and a drag,3.5,2021-10-24,rottentomatoes
excelente película una cinta totalmente merecedora ganadora de todos los premios que recibió no estaba seguro de qué esperar pero la trama los giros la reflexión ante los temas de interacción entre clases sociales la fotografía su mensaje final la dirección las actuaciones todo es excelente también tiene algunos toques de humor muy bien implementados en conjunto toda la película es muy entretenida por lo que es muy fácil de ver y no te vas a aburrir para nada me gusta que es original y mezcla varios géneros diferentes no entra en ningún molde si bien hace guiños a películas clásicas me parece muy original en conclusión una excelente película que creo yo todos deberían ver porque es genial y su final te termina impactando muy recomendada,5.0,2021-10-16,rottentomatoes

a really good movie and bcuz of it i start watching some korean movies,5.0,2021-09-19,rottentomatoes
fantastic definitely a different feel from most movies ive seen worth the watch and the insight into the social commentary i had a very different perception of this movie when i saw its poster it definitely turns dark very quickly at the end but then has a nice yet eerie resolution in the end would recommend if you enjoy film and something different,4.0,2021-09-19,rottentomatoes
parasite movie is outstanding it has many levels great detail and a fresh even harsh look at the richpoor divide in the world today some scenes evoke tarantinos signature but it is made in the best tradition of japanese movie art you cannot stop to think about this film even next day every body must see it and think about our wrong world where one part lives in prosperity and the other part struggles restlessly to survive,5.0,2021-09-18,rottentomatoes
since it received the 2020 best picture academy award i felt compelled to watch the film despite the fact that it was subtitled with no english overdub or audio description too bad i hadnt taken more than a couple of semesters of french in high school since they did have a french overdub track  it was a decent film im not sure it was worthy of best picture though,3.0,2021-09-15,rottentomatoes
hold on to your seats lots of twists and turns,4.5,2021-09-15,rottentomatoes
a surprising like for me though not sure why since i watch subtitled shows all the time in japanese i really enjoyed the peek into korean culture or at least what i assume to be korean culture its fresh and different it blends seriousness and comedy very well and its definitely up there for movies ive seen im not entirely sure about the message itself i rarely find that movies can deliver a stellar message like a book can as they dont seem to have enough time but its very entertaining and worth rewatching which i wouldnt say about too many movies,5.0,2021-09-13,rottentomatoes

one of my favorite movies,5.0,2021-08-30,rottentomatoes
what a rollercoaster the first thing that stood out was the cinematography and environments in this film which are gorgeous the structure of the story is subtle and peels away layers as its interesting characters become more involved in the plot the music elegantly heightens the tone of this film too the film is multilayered and universal in its themes but may lose some nuisance in the narrative screenplay due to its translation and being ingrained in korean culture people leeching off of others is apparent the social commentary here is blatant karma is a thing but what i felt resonated most was the importance of family the theme continuously appears throughout this film without you even realising but is ultimately driven home in the final scenes bong joon ho has constructed a modern film that hits the current zeitgeist of today but in a way that will not become dated parasite is a weave of dark tones intrigue mystery and humour and is the pinnacle of modern international cinema today,5.0,2021-08-29,rottentomatoes
i truly love this film its dark witty class satire is unlike anything ive seen in a long while,5.0,2021-08-24,rottentomatoes

another rewatch and this time its another bong joonho incredible work the first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living this wouldnt work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script the second half was where the themes became apparently clear the intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society through the conversations we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes and how fed up one can feel the use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle which made the script even more masterful overall arguably bong joonhos best work 9510,5.0,2021-07-19,rottentomatoes
parasite is an incredible thrilling suspenseful twisty sophisticated film not one moment on screen is wasted when this exciting plot is unfolding it is very difficult to praise this film without revealing any spoilers but if you are even curious about watching this watch it the discussion about the classism around the world is incredibly realized every actor does a wonderful job and the production value is really strong which just adds to the value of the film itself,5.0,2021-07-12,rottentomatoes
