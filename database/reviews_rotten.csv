4,2026.01.20,"good twist, however the first half dragged on."
5,2026.01.18,Foot on the gas from start to finish. Even with subtitles this movie kills it. The climactic ending is one of one.
4.5,2026.01.16,"Parasite leaves you with the feeling of having seen something truly different. It starts almost like a game, lowers your guard, and gradually pulls you into something far darker. One of its greatest strengths is how effortlessly it blends tones: black comedy, social satire and rising tension coexist without ever feeling forced. The film’s use of space and visual contrasts adds as much meaning as the dialogue, giving every scene a precise but never cold clarity. Bong Joon-ho observes rather than judges, letting the story speak for itself while pressing exactly where it hurts most. It’s smart, sharp, uncomfortable and deeply entertaining. Not quite perfect, but very close."
4,2026.01.15,8.5/10
5,2026.01.12,An example of a perfect film.
5,2026.01.11,"Is an absolute must-see. True, harsh, it hits you right in the face. This movie explains and makes you understand so many sad existing realities of our world"
5,2026.01.09,Timeless. A tasteful inspiration.
5,2026.01.04,"THE GOOD: At face value, the drama is very cartoony and almost sit com like. It's entertaining, sure, but it's not what makes this movie so good. What makes it so good is the layered messaging/symbolism hidden in so many scenes about classism. Acting is superb. cinematography is great. The twists and turns are all enticing and make you want to keep watching. The director teases so many different directions the movie COULD take. It's done masterfully to keep you engaged and on your toes the entire time. THE BAD: Some of the scenes are a little bit too cartoony/ridiculous for my liking. The father dragging himself across the room just looked bad. He clearly did it for the suspense and drama but for me it just landed flat. The other bad thing about this movie is that it's not for everyone. It's a thinker movie. That's why it's not super mainstream. It doesn't take away from the movie but it's definitely a downside. This is not a movie you turn on to be brainlessly entertained."
5,2026.01.04,"I didn't watch this film until well after it dominated at the Academy Awards. Much to my pleasant surprise, it absolutely lived up to its reputation. Simply incredible and engaging."
1.5,2026.01.03,Watched it because I saw it recommended on a horror site I follow. It was definitely not horror in any way. Really disappointed.
1,dec 28,Way over rated. horrible acting and fake blood. not worth it.
5,dec 28,"Yes, you have to watch subtitles. It's worth it: Smart, funny and poignant plot. And, as an added bonus, gives you some insight into South Korean culture."
0.5,dec 27,"Cara, que filme HORROROSO FOI ESSE? Só assisti porque simplesmente TODO MUNDO falou bem desse filme e que filme HORRÍVEL! Perdi 2h da minha vida!"
5,dec 20,"MARAVILHOSOOOOO. A direção, atuação… tudoooooo. A crítica social perfeita e super bem feita!!!!! Tudo é bem colocado, nada é coincidência… Queria que o mundo todo fosse obrigado a ver essa obra prima."
5,dec 15,"Unforgettable. One of my favorite movies that I’ve rewatched multiple times and never gets old. Evokes so many emotions from joy, to sadness, to unnerved and more. most importantly, the movie has a powerful message. 10/10 recommend"
1,dec 15,"This movie doesn't have a great plot when you think about it. The filmography is great, the acting is good enough, but if you lifted the plot of this movie out of the trappings of it's high production value, it stands to reason you would be bored out of your mind. It sort of makes me think it was written as a comedy initially and then someone just wanted to change the ending. Let's simplify: Let's say Woo is our main character. Does he learn anything? Does he change in anyway? Is he less likely to be a fraudster in the future? Nope, not really. And all of the nonsense with the former maid. None of it actually changes the story. If you replace the husband of the maid with any random person, the movie would fundamentally not change. There are plenty of people within the story: the driver, the mother, a the pissing homeless person - who could take the place and the movie would be the same. Just another high production movie that demands praise for blowing money."
5,dec 9,"Greatest movie of all time fight me on that the message portrays in amazing context and ways, I love the message itself since it’s from the poor and the rich. It’s amazing how they include elements to explain it."
5,dec 4,Powerful!!! One family lives off another causing harm. A parasite!
5,dec 3,"""Parasite"" is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Parasite"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market. Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."
2.5,2026.11.26,"Overhyped, decent but not anything special."
5,2026.11.26,"One of the best films in recent years. Funny, action packed, surprising and with a point. Plus it looks great."
5,2026.11.23,"I remember watching this first time and not being a fan of it. So after almost 6 years after the release I gave this Movie a watch again since I couldnt remember anything of it. This absolutely blew me away, when I saw the ending I was speechless, it was just sad and absoloutely shocking at the same time and the one iconic scene with the man walking up the stars, while the boy is eating his cake, sends you shivers down your spine. Im glad I watched this Movie once again because this gave me a whole other portrait of this Movie, this is a masterpiece."
4,2026.11.22,Will need a good understanding of both movies and social life. great movie btw.
5,2026.11.20,Best movie of all time.
5,2026.11.20,Definitely his masterpiece. And everyone you talk to loves this movie. I love this movie. Meant to be watched again and again.
5,2026.11.13,"So many genres in one film with such a complicated, sharp critique of the impacts of classism and inequality on one’s humanity."
5,2026.11.12,"Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite represents a paradigmatic breakthrough in contemporary global cinema, an incisive exploration of class, capitalism, and human duplicity rendered with both stylistic audacity and narrative precision. The film’s meticulous mise-en-scène transforms the domestic sphere into a symbolic theater of socio-economic tension, where architectural design, spatial hierarchy, and visual composition become instruments of storytelling as potent as dialogue. Each performance, from the parasitic Kim family to the oblivious Parks, oscillates between caricature and startling verisimilitude, sustaining a tonal dexterity that shifts seamlessly between dark comedy, suspense, and moral horror. Bong’s screenplay interrogates systemic inequality with surgical wit, exposing the grotesque absurdities and inevitable tragedies that emerge from entrenched social stratification. Parasite is not merely a cinematic triumph; it is an intellectual and aesthetic reckoning, a work in which the personal and political, the grotesque and the elegiac, coalesce into a singularly compelling meditation on the human condition—a film that justifiably reshaped the international cinematic landscape."
5,2026.11.10,"From the darkly comic to the deeply tragic, Parasite has everything. Designed as a masterful combination of drama, thriller, and black comedy, it tells the story of two families from completely opposite worlds — one poor, one rich — whose lives intertwine in unpredictable and unsettling ways. If you’re looking for something intense, thought‑provoking, and unforgettable, it’s definitely worth seeing this film. As a movie fan myself, I was really delighted to watch such a fascinating mix of humor and suspense. The first thing that caught my eye was the film’s perfect balance between realism and symbolism. Initially, I thought it was simply satire ridiculing the big gap in social inequality, but actually it turns into a gripping psychological thriller that keeps you guessing. Among all the elements of the film, there are some truly intelligent ideas too, like how the director shows social inequality and moral corruption through space and architecture. My personal favourite? The shocking twist halfway through the film — brilliant and haunting. If you like movies that combine strong storytelling with sharp social commentary and creepy moments, Parasite is an absolute must‑see!"
2.5,2026.11.09,Too dark for yours truly.
4.5,2026.11.06,Everything you heard about this film is true....its amazing!
4.5,2026.11.03,Very good movie. Would like to watch again. 87/100
5,2026.11.01,"Fascinating , engaging , imaginative story !"
5,2026.11.01,"Amazing, watched it twice. Did not watch the blak and white version. Not artsy enough for that and to appreciate it."
4.5,2026.10.30,"wow, this is incredible. glad i finally got around to it"
5,2026.10.30,Best movie of all time
5,2026.10.29,No spoilers. Haven't seen a movie this good in a hot minute. This one was worth a watch to say the least. No critique.
4.5,2026.10.28,"I really really loved Parasite, and it's definitely up there in my top 5. I mean, what more do you want from a movie? Amazing soundtrack, amazingly creative and sound plot that gripped me all the way to the end, amazing acting from an amazing cast and an amazingly twisted ending. The reason why this review is so short is because I literally have nothing else to say about it. Not gonna spoil anything if you haven't seen it, so go watch Parasite."
4,2026.10.28,"I really like the dynamic between characters but as the story builds it gets a little to dramatic for my taste (like a transition from drama to hysterics and splatter), but I remember thinking the same when watching Korean movies earlier."
1.5,2026.10.26,"Save your time for something else. Can't belive it won an ocar for best picture. Plot goes no where, characters don't develop. I lkied the architecture fo the house. Seriously that is the best thing in this movie."
5,2026.10.26,"An intelligent and absorbing film, one that stays in your memory"
5,2026.10.24,Adore this film. What a movie should be.
5,2026.10.12,Amazing piece of cinema.
5,2026.10.08,Masterfully suspenseful
5,2026.10.04,one of these movies you can’t forget about. and i definitely don’t want to forget. everything here is perfect.
1,2026.09.24,"I dreaded watching this but I wanted to understand the feeding frenzy over this vulgar stupid movie. Each character was unattractive & unlikable in his (or her) own way. The plot was absurd. I can’t think of anything that could’ve made this boring meditation on sociopathy come to life The inexplicable, over-the-top violence is a substitute for character development. The characters are all the same. There’s nothing positive to recommend wasting two perfectly good hours watching this disgusting sensationalism with neither message nor plot"
4,2026.09.20,Just go for it absolutely best movie from South Korea every department goes well in this movie
5,2026.09.20,Ye people may live in my walls too… Peak Content 🧌
4.5,2026.09.20,"Really good. Would recommend. Good acting and kept me gussing. Ending was annoying. If the dad hadnt lost it they could have gotten away with it, pinning the murder of the wide and attack on the crazy husband."
5,2026.09.13,"It started light and funny but turned so intense and shocking—I didn’t see that ending coming. Smart, gripping, and it sticks in your head long after."
5,2026.09.12,"Parasite is a brilliant psychological thriller that explores class disparity through the story of a poor family who deceitfully infiltrates a wealthy household. As their manipulation deepens, the film reveals both the absurdity and tragedy of blind trust and social inequality. With its unpredictable plot and morally grey characters, Parasite delivers a sharp, thought-provoking critique wrapped in dark humor and suspense. Read the full review here: (Indonesian version : alunauwie.com)"
1,2026.09.10,"The movie is too generic, having nothing to offer. every event is predictable and that's all."
4.5,2026.09.08,"Fantastic story, performances and cinematography. This movie was great and kept me glued to the screen and on my heels from start to finish."
5,2026.09.02,"This is a work of Art not a movie, absolute masterpiece!! Engrossing, shocking, emotional and raw....a must watch."
5,2026.09.01,Top 10 all time for me. I have never seen a movie so good like the parasite.
5,2026.08.31,"Parasite is extremely engaging, has a great build-up to the chaos, and has 1 or 2 really shocking plot twists that seem possible in real life."
5,2026.08.31,Absolute Cinema Bong never miss..
5,2026.08.30,A Haiku Review: Heartbreaking portrait Of class struggle compromises Beautifully shot
5,2026.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
3.5,2026.08.25,"An entertaining black comedy, yet with a less plausible plot, where a whole family just too easily goes from folding pizza boxes to completely taking over a wealthy household."
4.5,2026.08.23,Not much to say its just good
4.5,2026.08.23,"SPOILER ALERT I'll start by saying that this film is intelligently written. It was a hilarious black comedy and was well on its way to being a masterpiece in my eyes, and then came the final act. It went from black comedy to full dark tragedy with an ending that was all over the place. I'll admit, this picture is too well-made to not be considered a great film, but it deserved a proper ending. Something definitive. This ending just did not work for me. It was certainly strange, but not in a good way. It was not boring, I'll say that. It just lacked a proper resolution. In my humble opinion, this movie could have ended in a number of ways and still would have been a masterpiece, but the way it ended seemed more like a collage of unfinished ideas. No matter how I feel about the story's end, I most definitely recommend this one. 92/100"
2.5,2026.08.19,I mean I’m glad I watched it because at least I know I didn’t miss out on anything.
5,2026.08.05,Yeah this movie slaps right here
5,2026.08.01,If you’re going to watch any foreign movie this should be the one.
5,2026.07.25,"I love this movie so much. I was so into it I literally forgot to breathe. Everything the vibe, the characters, the scenes, the lines just felt perfect."
1,2026.07.21,"I genuinely have no idea why this movie is so popular. The acting is good, but the storyline and plot are boring. This movie is fuc*ing boring. What is wrong with people?"
5,2026.07.21,Fantastic. This is a great movie.
5,2026.07.20,"Parasita te fisga já nos primeiros minutos e não larga até o último frame. Bong Joon-ho mistura comédia e drama com maestria, mostrando a família Kim lutando por cada centavo enquanto cai de cara no universo luxuoso (e cego) da família Park. O contraste social é exibido de forma afiada — ora absurda, ora dolorosamente real — sem cair em moralismo. A narrativa é construída como um relógio suíço: cada detalhe aparentemente trivial no começo volta com força total para amarrar o clímax surpreendente. A sutileza das piadas, aliada à tensão crescente, transforma o filme numa montanha-russa emocional. E, por baixo de tudo, pulsa uma crítica social poderosa, que expõe as fissuras da desigualdade sem soçobrar em discursos óbvios. Com atuações impecáveis, direção cirúrgica e um roteiro que equilibra tons sem titubear, Parasita não é apenas entretenimento — é cinema feito para incomodar, divertir e deixar a gente pensando por muito tempo."
5,2026.07.19,I’m so glad they added that ending cause SPOILER ALERT I would not have been able to stand it if they ended the movie right at that garden scene
5,2026.07.18,"Story is brilliantly woven, almost rhythmic like a sharp jazz drum solo. The film reveals that human flaws aren’t born from wealth or poverty, but are magnified by both. A blend of style, substance, and unsettling truth. Fun as hell from start to finish."
5,2026.07.18,Amazing and interesting all the way through.
4.5,2026.07.17,Great movie with great acting and makes you feel on edge the whole time and is surprisingly tragic
5,2026.07.17,"Really great film, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time."
5,2026.07.11,"I believe Bong Joon Ho has become a master director. The first film he directed and that I saw was Parasite. I was blown away by his directing, the production, cinematography and acting. A S. Korean friend who also enjoys Parasite told me that the class differences, their style or ability to live is spot on. I have watched this film many times, and will watch it many more times in the future. It is in my personal top 10 foreign film list."
5,2026.07.10,"I think about this film quite often,it is that good."
5,2026.07.09,A cinematic masterpiece. It is perhaps the most perfectly-paced film of all-time. The story remains both compelling and elusive throughout. The plot is like a Russian nesting doll unfolding one twist after another. A truly perfect film.
4.5,2026.07.09,"This movie was unexpectedly a masterpiece and also smartly funny and really well executed. I can’t really say anything cause this movie is just straight up a masterpiece and a must watch experience. I recommend you this art, it will blow your mind"
5,2026.07.09,I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Bong Joon Ho and Song Kang-Ho are AMAZING. One of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
4.5,2026.07.08,Never does a home play a leading role like the architectural masterpiece in Parasite. A home doesn't make a family; only people can. Mental illness doesn't discriminate between socio-economic classes. This isn't a Disney movie; especially ending.
0.5,2026.07.07,"I am baffled why this movie was given so much attention. I couldn't even get past the first 35 minutes which were very slow going. I had absolutely zero emotional investment in the characters. When I look at audience reviews on this and other platforms, they seem over-the-top to the extent that it makes me wonder who was paid off and how. Nothing against the actors or the direction. It's just that there are so much better films."
4.5,2026.07.07,A very good film. I enjoyed every minute of it.
0.5,2026.07.06,"This movie has such high ratings, but I tried streaming it twice and abandoned it twice."
5,2026.07.05,An original masterpiece of storytelling. This was a super fun watch. Although it’s in a different language than my own I enjoyed it greatly.
5,2026.07.04,Great masterpiece 👌
5,2026.07.02,Great film. The last 25 minutes is astounding! Simply a masterpiece!
4.5,2026.07.02,"The story builds so well that when the chaos finally hits, it feels earned and unforgettable."
5,2026.06.30,One of the best movies ever produced.
5,2026.06.29,"One of my favorite movies and I don’t think recency bias will change that. It’s just one of those stories that is super original, contains a lot of metaphors, and keeps you wondering what will happen next. I went in with zero context and loved it. Also saw this in black and white which was cool I guess? Saw it again at home in color and it was even better."
5,2026.06.25,Good movie with great themes of classism. Definitely recommend. This is probably a career peak for the director
5,2026.06.22,Best Foreign movie I have ever seen Bong Joon Ho did it again
5,2026.06.20,"A superb film that makes you grateful for what you do have. You find yourself feeling the emotions the characters experience throughout and thinking about your life and where you can relate within the film. It's well written, beautifully acted and extremly thought provoking. Cinematography is excellent as well."
5,2026.06.17,"Ok, I was skeptical that a foreign film won Best Movie Oscar? This movie= Weird, but in a super cool way, almost like a David Lynch type film. Ultimately it's a Very Sad movie. I've seen other Korean films and though they usually are ok- they don't compare to American movies, this one, just based on it's originality and story, deserves the 5 stars- I don't give many that. The acting was good and not too hokey which Korean acting can be at times. The dialogue was good, some of it funny, and it's nicely directed and shot. Korea is Now, what America will be in 50 years- poverty and suffering so a few people can have everything they want. I'm gonna ruminate over this today and it's obviously going to stay in my collection. Great Film."
5,2026.06.05,Wish I could give it ten stars!
4.5,2026.06.04,This movie proves that Bong Joon Ho is a GENIUS!
5,2026.06.04,I ain’t got much to say that hasn’t been said already.
5,2026.06.03,Watched it with my brother and we can't get over how good and gruesome it is in it's nature. A MUST WATCH.
5,2026.05.30,This is what great Cinema looks like Phenomenal acting and direction and brilliant in all the technical aspects. But the storyline and underlying message make it a masterpiece
5,2026.05.22,Black humor that comes with a dreary tension
0.5,2026.05.17,Do yourself a favour and scroll past this movie. Total rubbish!
5,2026.05.16,Incredibly good! Of my favorites of the last decade.
5,2026.05.14,"great movie and story, got me hooked to the screen..."
5,2026.05.14,Una obra de arte espectacular película me dejó sin palabras
4.5,2026.05.14,One of the best films of the decade.
5,2026.05.13,o sistema é foda.
5,2026.05.11,"The first Korean-language movie to win the Academy Award for Best Picture!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Success in 2 hours and 12 minutes!!!!!!!!!! LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The USA grossed over $53,700,000.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,2026.05.10,"Loved that movie, I hadn't seen the trailer before and it was a complete surprise! Climax, direction, writing, everything is incredible!"
0.5,2026.05.07,"Could have been enjoyable, if it wasn't so tragic"
5,2026.05.04,"I watched this movie a few times now and keep on being amazed by the story line, production and the downfall of being greedy"
5,2026.05.02,A beautiful film that brings you on a fun journey then leaves you stunned and introspective. My #1
5,2026.05.01,Vaya obra maestra
4.5,2026.04.18,"It's a bit overrated but 200K people seem to think this movie was the best movie of the 21st century. I've watched a lot of Korean revenge movies and this was probably not at the top. However for awards purposes I can see why it is ranked so high, Korean movies/shows were never really publicized until recently. Look at Squid Game, the reason it got global publicity was because of Netflix. Without Netflix it never would have gotten so much fame."
5,2026.04.18,"All Time Classic. The editing and pacing are masterful. It reminds me of something that Hitchcock or even the Coen Brothers would make. It's extremely witty, has really good dark humor, and has tons of underlying commentary about poverty and a two class society and the different human expierence by each and how those worlds collide. It's an extremely intelligent thiller. The cinematography is first rate as well. The shots inside the house, deep focus, lighting, and direction are all just masterful. Everything else is really good. Never really seen something like this. Everyone should should give this a try once."
5,2026.04.16,Just an incredible movie which shows the different lives between different households. 1 poor and 1 rich. And Bong Joon Ho's directing is just incredible. Deserved every Oscar it won.
5,2026.04.09,"a great movie in every way, an even better plane movie. But don't get scared away by it being in a different language it still is a perfect movie."
5,2026.03.26,"Totally deserves the 4 Oscar awards it has won. Took me a while before I finally saw it, masterpiece! Watch it without reading any more info about it. Dont watch the trailer. I didnt and it was full of surprises for me."
5,2026.03.25,"Downloaded this on the plane, thought it would suck... Might be one of the best movies I've watched."
4,2026.03.24,"Hey, I just wanted to give you a heads-up that this review might contain some spoilers for the movie ""Parasite."" The movie starts with the story of the main character's family. They live in a small basement room and aren't very healthy. They make a living by folding pizza boxes, which isn't a very well-paying job. Their financial struggles are so big that they turn to public insecticides, administered via wifi, and have to use them inshared spaces.Money problems also mean that they can't go to college.But then, the protagonist meets someone who helps him and his family move in with a rich person. His initial job as an English tutor, where he gained his teaching credentials, was followed by his rise to a professional position as an art instructor, a role that also required him to get his teaching credentials, since his sister, who was also his art instructor, didn't have much money.Despite the lack of financial resources, the hero's creativity and methods won over the mother and child.It's heartwarming to see how he found his way to become a loving art instructor. Then, the father allowed him to become a driver, which he did with a clever plan. The film is full of moments that shed light on classism, like when the rich mother hits the car seat with her foot or when the rich father pretends to smell the hero's father.There's also a conversation between the rich husband and wife about the driver's body odor, drug trafficking, and underwear in the car that looks insulted. It all builds up to a point where the hero's father feels so insulted that he has to stab the rich father to death. Thoughts from this movie In our world, people who don't have a lot of money often have to work really hard to take care of themselves. It's more important for them to think about themselves than to think about other people. Even when we plan everything life doesn't always go as we'd hoped, as the hero's father learned the hard way. It's important to see challenges as chances to grow, like when the hero decided to become a tutor in a rich family to boost his family's finances and used his cooking skills to help out. But, as we all know, being greedy can sometimes bring about our own downfall. And that's exactly what happened to the hero's family. Their greed and the actions that followed led to a heartbreaking outcome. Overall of this movie This movie is a really great example of how different people's lives can be. It shows how the lower class and the upper class live, and how they feel about each other. It's a really interesting story that keeps you hooked for almost two hours. It's not a story with a lot of characters, but each character has their own interesting story and history. There are also clues throughout the movie that you have to look out for."
5,2026.03.23,Perfect from start to finish! It’s been my favorite for years.
3.5,2026.03.23,"Good movies, but NOT Best Picture great. The social commentaries are spot on, pacing is good, ending is phenomenal, however still lacks that quality of memorable from a great movie like dialogue, memorable characters and overall feeling left once seen."
4,2026.03.22,"Very good film. It describes the different life style of the 2 families ver well. My only negatives are there are a couple of scenes which weren’t needed as much, but overall, very good."
5,2026.03.22,Parasite review I love this movie it’s so funny and so messed up but kelp me entertained 5 star 10 out 10 star 100 out 100 star
5,2026.03.19,"Engaging and conniving. The movie shoes that you need need explosions and CGI to tell a story that keeps you hooked. There's enough truth and caricaturizing in each character, so that everyone is important to the story. Don't spoil your first view by reading the plot or watching trailers. Just watch it and you'll be satisfied through and through."
5,2026.03.18,"I thought this movie was brilliant. I'm not usually one for closed captions, but this one is well worth it!"
5,2026.03.12,"There is one word and one word only that describes this film and its essence, and that word? ""Perfection"" is that word. I genuinely couldn't find ONE flaw in the film, from cinematography, to wide shots, acting, looks, side characters, this are very few movies that I can 100% say, is AMAZING and PERFECT, and this is one, you've done yourself a distaste by not watching this film"
0.5,2026.03.10,Didn't make it 30 minutes they first 29 were so painfull. This might be the worst movie ever made. Completely unwatchable.
5,2026.03.09,Incredible!! Defiantly recommend!!
4.5,2026.03.07,Classic modern day cinematic roller-coaster. What a joy to ride.
5,2026.03.06,"This movie has two experiences: that when watching & when remembering. For the first, I felt it's pace slow. But, like the title, it's impact grew within me and lingers still."
5,2026.03.04,"Magnificent ! A film that does what very few modern films seem to be able to do: make a highly entertaining film where the social messaging is apparent but it doesn’t overwhelm the rest of the experience. Edgy, dark, funny and devastating."
5,2026.03.02,Perfect Film!!! Simply a Masterpiece!!!!
5,2026.02.27,"Brilliant and razor-sharp social critique disguised as a thriller, balancing dark humor, tension, and drama with absolute mastery. Gripping story that exposes class struggles in a way that feels both universal and deeply unsettling. The film constantly shifts tones and keeps you on edge, making its message hit even harder. In a few words, it’s a cinematic masterpiece that sticks with you long after the credits roll."
2.5,2026.02.26,It was ok. A bit overhyped IMO. I didn't find any of the characters particularly relatable or likable. The Host was a much more entertaining film by Bong.
4.5,2026.02.25,"Great acting, movie was super interesting. Thought the scheming and the characters felt realistic. Was interesting to see a different world dynamic struggle between the poor and the rich. Top 5 of my movies this year and I wish I had seen it sooner."
5,2026.02.20,I have seen this movie so many times and I never get bored of it. I absolutely recommend it!
5,2026.02.20,"A wild story where you find yourself rooting for the villainous underdog. Parasite showcases the divide of classes in South Korea, which is familiar worldwide. Beautifully shot film with lots of heart, suspense, thrills and laughs."
4.5,2026.02.19,Bong Joon Ho is quite brilliant. It’s the class levels that are becoming the greatest divider of society. Wealth doesn’t insure dignity and class.
5,2026.02.13,This masterpiece about social classes was so intense in the IMAX theater!
4.5,2026.02.13,All time greatest! Had all the feels...literally all the feels
5,2026.02.12,love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.
5,2026.02.11,"I believe it is wonderful how the director is able to transform a seemingly normal beggining into a tenseful film that catches your attention fully. I also must applause the form the movie uses ""unharmful"" scenes to do so, in a way that, little by little, you understand the feeling of complete tiredoom from the poorer family. Absolutily unsettling and extraordinarius!"
5,2026.02.11,"Third act was rough, just like every Osgood Perkins movie, but this one has something the others don't, which is incredibly gory deaths and impeccable comedic timing."
1.5,2026.02.11,"I was advised to watch this without learning anything about it, that's what I did, no summary, no trailers. I only knew it won Best Picture so my expectations were high. Unfortunately I was let down big time. I expect to care about characters, I did not care about these. There was no one to root for, no hero, no attachment at all. It was like watching your neighbor's life that you couldn't care less about, drag on and on, until you realize in this case, that the twist and resolution was not meaningful either, as if the writer needed a conclusion and asked around for the most ridiculous ideas, then simply chose one and wrote it in. One review characterized this film as ""vapid"" and I fully agree. A good movie will at least move me emotionally in some way. This didn't do that either."
5,2026.02.10,Uma loucura de bom. Me surpreendeu o desfecho. Simplesmente amei.
5,2026.02.10,Loved it the first 4 times I originally saw it in the theater. ow eve better in IMAX. Keep re-releasing great films like this and I will show up at the theater every week!
5,2026.02.10,A family of con artists. Filled with twists. An all-time favorite. “Does dripping his sperm on my seat turn him on?”
5,2026.02.10,JUST GO SEE IT IN IMAX
5,2026.02.10,"Parasite is the perfect entry way into foreign film. I watched it for the first time during my second year of college. Since Parasite, I have been released into a new world of artistic cinema. The captivating use of lighting, environmental framing, and metaphorical ark makes Parasite critical to the dedicated audience."
5,2026.02.09,"Third time watching this film. Incredible. Thrilling, thoughtful, meticulous. Love it."
4.5,2026.02.09,"This movie was amazing, I think you should watch it if you like thrillers that reflect on society and has something new at every turn"
5,2026.02.08,Bong Joon-ho knocked it out of the park with this one. Seeing it in IMAX was especially powerful. Highly recommend.
1,2026.02.08,Boring and stupid. Waste of time.
5,2026.02.08,One of the best films of the decade.
4.5,2026.02.05,"A good example of fiction that inspires introspection, shows social commentary, but also doesn't skimp on dynamic entertainment. In a sea of movies that go through the social media fame and come out the other side as overrated, Parasite sustains its worth."
3.5,2026.02.03,"It’s a compartmentalized concept, somehow expanded to be grander than it needs to be, but it works… and I’m not really sure why."
5,2026.02.01,"indeed capitalism made us parasite in some way. love the plot it's actually a crazy one, cinematography and screenplay is amazing truly deserved the Oscar win for International Film Feature and Best Picture! please produce more films like this one, love it sm!"
5,2026.01.30,"In the year 2019 it has been a very busy year for films that actually have a seal of approval of films I've watched at that year. Some of which I haven't reviewed apart from three of them such as Little Women, The Gentlemen, Joker, The Irishman, Marriage Story, Uncut Gems, Toy Story 4, Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood, John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum and Avengers: Endgame, now we have a film which is a foreign film that many people including myself really, really love and we'll cherish it forever in years to come and that foreign film is got to be Parasite. Yes, Parasite, one of most anticipated films of all time and one of the memorable ones out there. Many people had difficulty watching it without knowing what they're saying but the subtitles can help them understand and since that this is another foreign film I reviewed I think I should be doing more if I had the chance. The Kim family lives in a semi-basement flat (banjiha) in Seoul, have low-income jobs, and struggle for money as they're all unemployed. Min-hyuk, a family friend, gives the family a scholar's rock meant to promise wealth. Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that the Kims' son, Ki-woo, lie about his education to take over his job as an English language tutor for Da-hye, the daughter of the rich but naïve Park family. After his sister Ki-jung helps create a false certificate for him in Photoshop, Ki-woo, posing as a Yonsei University student, is hired by the Parks. Moments later, Kim's family takes peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks for their livelihood until something goes wrong. What makes this film so great is the its masterful blend of social commentary, suspenseful storytelling, complex characters, exceptional cinematography, and a tightly woven plot that explores the stark realities of class inequality, all delivered with a unique blend of dark humor and thrilling twists, making it a thought-provoking and engaging cinematic experience for viewers from diverse backgrounds. I'll be very honest here, it's not for me doing this review. There are millions of people who actually and giving it highest 5 star or 10/10 making it a much more worthy film even for a foreign film like there are many foreign films that really deserve more praise and never overlook them as a miss and this one is not because it's been loved by so many who love it even this film is on the list of films in Rotten Tomatoes, IMDB, Metacritic, even Letterboxd and I've been thinking: ""Is there any of me doing this review?"" and I know what's done has to be done just like I have to do a lot of movies I'll be doing next time, many which that are great and some of them are bad I have to rant to make you laugh. Like this movie here which is darkly comical unexpectedly. Even if you can understand the ending and everything about this film is immense. With many words to describe this movie, you know exactly what I mean so with that said, Parasite is one of the best films and best foreign films of 2019."
5,2026.01.29,"There are just a few directors that have accomplished such a complex and unique combination of feelings, genres and twists, all of these in one movie. Bong Joon-ho did it, and he did it great. It's a movie about capitalism. About that intrinsic sense of belonging and owning, in societies so different, but so alike at the same time. The chemistry and behavior between the characters and their ""plans"" will keep you on the edge of your seat. You will ask yourself through the whole movie, who is the ""parasite"" of the story. A closer look at a family living in some unfortunate conditions and the contrast with the upper class, and how far will they go to have whatever (they think) they need to be happy."
3.5,2026.01.24,حلو بس مش واو 70% تقييمى
5,2026.01.23,A masterful movie in every way
3.5,2026.01.23,"The ending is effective but I'm not sure it says much, other than that the disparities between rich and poor are senseless; that they breed mutual enmity out of resentment and indignation, or a sense of effete, supercillious perogative. It's layered, sure. It's also well executed; and in it's own way incisive. But honestly, I don't think it's ultimately saying anything a reasonably intelligent person, with enough life experience hasn't figured out for themselves already. Or maybe I've just been poor for too long? Are you stinking rich? Well, good for you! Watch Parasite. Or don't, no one will care, least of all you, either way. Are you poor? Well, you probably won't be overly impressed. Are you middle-class? Well, no one cares for your opinions of this film, excepting other middle class folk of course. So have at it!"
4,2025.01.18,Parasite isn't the grand treatise on class disparity that people have made it out to be. But it's a great thriller that's just ridiculous enough to keep from being too depressing.
5,2025.01.17,"An amazing dark comedy thriller that seamlessly blends clever satire and dreadful tension about class divide and how it forces otherwise good people into a fight for survival by any means necessary. Despite the subtitles, I was so engrossed by the almost-hypnotic visual storytelling, the easily relatable identifiable performances, and the page-turner narrative that constantly keeps you on your toes with not knowing where the story's going yet continuously building upon itself with amazingly brisk pacing despite its 2+ hour runtime. I love how there's so many layers to the themes and even who's the real titular ""parasite"" given all the individual actions vs the root systematic cause of their actions. It's also just genuinely hilarious despite the dark turn it takes. But even that dark turn feels naturally woven into the narrative without feeling like cheap scares for shock value. It's an amazing cinematic experience and easily one of my favorite movies of 2019."
5,2025.01.12,Parasite is one of the best movies ever created. A true masterpiece!!!!
5,2025.01.12,"An amazing movie full of twists, turns, never ending surprises, this was a movie I didn't know much about (other than the shortest of summaries and the fact it won the Oscar for best picture). It exceeded all expectations for me."
5,2025.01.07,"Bursting with ideas and a complete hodgepodge of genres that all come together quite brilliantly, this is a rare film indeed and a thrill ride to boot."
5,2025.01.05,"Nothing to add, a modern masterpiece."
1,2025.01.04,One of the worst films I've seen. Should really be renamed Parashi*e.
5,2024.12.29,The best movie I ever seen in my life
5,2024.12.28,"Challenging social comentary and reflection on social pressures on individuals/families. Wonderful tension in the story and between the characters. Some big moments, with expert presentation and handling. It isn't just entertaining, it is edifying and challenging."
3.5,2024.12.26,Good and thought-provoking movie? Yes. Number 1 on endless lists and worthy of an Oscar? Not in my opinion.
4,2024.12.25,8.3/10 прекрасный фильм
5,2024.12.22,"Incredible at making you uncomfortable, and plot was great"
5,2024.12.19,You will fall in love with Korean cinema
0.5,2024.12.15,"Solo a un cinefilo puede parecerle una obra maestra, porque es el mismo tipo de personas que le fascina ver una pila de baldes con arena caerse. Para colmo un tipo escribe: ""La mejor pelicula de todos los tiempos"", seguro es la unica pelicula que vio."
5,2024.12.15,"This film is pure genius. There is nothing imperfect about this movie. It is funny, thrilling, dramatic, and satirical all at once in the best possible way. This movie has so much to say about the way that we think about and treat others and presents these thoughts through and interesting plot, genius dialogue, and amazing acting. This movie is the perfect length and is a constant thrill ride that never really slows down. The ending is amazing and satisfies the viewer in all ways. I am thrilled to see more films by Bong Joon-Ho and am especially excited for Mickey 17 this spring."
5,2024.12.12,Eu fiquei pensando em um roteiro tão simples que ganhou vários prêmios.
5,2024.12.09,The greatest movie of all time
4.5,2024.12.03,"Don't get me wrong, this was a great movie but was it the best movie I've seen in years? I wouldn't go that far. Still, the acting was amazing. The cinematography was stellar. The story was great but it wasn't necessarily mind blowing."
0.5,2024.11.30,"Most overrated and overhyped film I've seen in forever. And I was SO up for this film. LITERALLY every other film that was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars that this was up against were better than this. It shouldn't have even been nominated! And yes, I DID 'get it' AND understand it, it was still terrible."
4,2024.11.22,Nice casting. Coming with a story that will depict what the society is ideed.
3,2024.11.20,"Everyone raves about this movie. I mean YA, I GET IT, ITS GOOD. I just didn't like the way it made me feel. You know? I felt like I was anxious and like I was cringing the whole movie. Maybe it's just because I watched it by myself, but I don't know. Still giving it 3 stars, and you can kick rocks if this rating pisses you off."
3.5,2024.11.19,"It's a nice and high-quality movie to watch. I really liked the course of events, but there were some boring scenes, but I think it's a quality movie with a good progression. It's worth watching."
5,2024.11.15,This is a once in a lifetime masterpiece. It deserves all of the oscars it’s won and so much more. This film is etched into my memory forever as a work of art.
5,2024.11.04,Incredible film from start to finish. Combines genres and delivers tension without sacrificing a gripping story. Deserves all the accolades and more.
5,2024.11.03,"I just finished watching the Film. The first thing I need to say, shouldn't be about the film itself but rather about the feelings within me right after it. I am sure many of you might know the painful feeling of emptiness, one might experience if ones favorite Series, with characters and a Story, you had the chance to bond to over an extensive amount of time and many episodes and seasons, comes to an end. You just feel without a clear goal. It feels like a good friend has died (ok maybe not that bad) and you need to learn what to do with yourself again after having got used to spending all your time with him/her. This was the first movie, that made me feel this way. You might say, that feeling like this might sound like a terrible thing, and in some way it is. But if I personally deeply think about it I would object. This feeling is a wonderful testiment of how great a movie was able to touch the viewers emotion and soul. In a weird philosophical way it is proof of the true humanity of everybody that feels it. I dont think this movies brilliance can be boiled down or be dissected in individual parts like cinematography, characters or story. It is the great sum of all those parts that creates the true brilliance, being the feelings it awakens in its viewers. It perfectly mirrors an each and every humans being in a way. This is why you might feel a rush of those described negative emotions. But if you think about it and feel really deep within yourself...It also awakens the feeling of being understood and a part of a greater, loneliness-expelling community of beings that are in some or another way connected by interest or emotion and therefore possess the ability to archieve wonderful and amazing feats... ...such as creating this movie"
4,2024.10.27,"A masterful blend of dark humor and social commentary, delivered a thrilling narrative with unexpected twists."
4,2024.10.21,"As entertaining as it may be, the ending meets the viewer's expectations."
4,2024.10.17,"This Movie was intense! Beautifully filmed and well-depicted lessons on greed from many perspectives. You can see the tarantinoesc way about this film, but ultimately, this film was its own thing. The framing and the simplicity of dialogue and vision were powerful. Though the violence and this type of intensity sometimes aren't my favorite still, this movie had such awe about it it made sense that it got a movie of the year! It drew you in. For me, there's no need to see it twice, but glad I saw it once."
5,2024.10.15,Absolute masterpiece
4,2024.10.15,"Really good movie! Beautiful cinematography too. I did not like that much some of the events at the end, but still good."

3.5,2024.10.08,Temas sociais que permeiam a classe média e alta da Coreia do Sul são o foco desse drama premiado pela academia com quatro Oscares.

5,2024.10.02,"Stunning, captivating, comedic yet real, raw. Incredible piece."
5,2024.09.29,"Bong Joon Ho is really one of the best directors right now. Parasite, even with this insane ending, it's still so human. what an amazing movie."
1,2024.09.17,An extraordinarily ugly film. The fact that it's done so well only adds to the disgust of it all.
5,2024.09.15,Really good movie.The plot might be confusing unless you look up videos online
5,2024.09.13,The OG eat the rich. The crown jewel of the sub-genre.
3,2024.09.11,"I don’t get the exaggerated hype. Sure, this is one unpredictable plot with great cinematography and performances, sprinkled with an entrancing soundtrack. That makes it far from perfect nonetheless. The first part is tedious and seems elongated, while the second part is not that different, except for a slightly-rushed infamous scene. As a whole, Parasite is peculiar but also somewhat pretentious, and this has nothing to do with the portrayal of a snobbish bunch, but rather with the way through which this snobby-needy juxtaposition is dealt with. In a world of extremes where the ratings for this movie are either 5 stars or just half a star, I choose to take the rocky path, and declare the following: this isn’t a movie one would find oneself itching to watch again any time soon, but it also isn’t one short of standing beside the classics."
0.5,2024.09.10,Hated this boring movie. I should have been warned when the critics like something.
4,2024.09.05,"Watched this without any knowledge of what it was about on an airplane. I knew it was a contender for best film a few years ago but didn't know anything more. I was pretty entertained and shocked in a good way by the film. It was pretty stressful at times, but a good movie makes you feel things! Would recommend."
5,2024.09.02,"Parasite is a hands-down masterpiece. Cinematography, acting, atmosphere and plot are flawless; it is pure fun from beginning to end."
5,2024.09.01,No wonder this film won an oscar it's amazing.
5,2024.08.31,"Best movie I've seen in 2024. By far. Checks every box for a great film - character development, plot twists, script, acting, and an incredible story arc. A must see indeed."
5,2024.08.30,Great movie. Very metaphorical.
5,2024.08.27,"Its sad sometimes seeing the diferences between the people who has a lot of money an the people tha don’t. This movie explore that feeling and how that feeling of being diferent is slowly grown up and becoming angry, violence."
4.5,2024.08.25,Dark comedy. That ending. RIP.
5,2024.08.25,"Parasite offers a disturbing analysis of current social disparities, delving deeply into the complexities of modern capitalism. The movie presents a meticulously structured narrative and uses a powerful metaphor to illustrate the tensions of a divided society. As an engaging class warfare thriller, Bong Joon-ho not only critiques the system but does so in a provocative and original way, avoiding didacticism. The result is a cinematic experience that challenges and intrigues, providing deep satisfaction and lasting reflection."
5,2024.08.24,One of the best foreign films you could ever watch.
5,2024.08.24,"""Parasite"" transita por gêneros, de maneira genial e visceral. Com uma bela construção narrativa, que aos poucos vai criando suas consequências, causando o espectador ficar instigado com a trama genial composta por Bong Joon-ho."
5,2024.08.21,"One of the best movies of all time. Absolutely S tier. If you liked this one, I urge you to watch Oldboy."
5,2024.08.21,This movie is art as well as entertainment
5,2024.08.19,"parasite is definitely my favorite movie in the world. the choice of the character it’s literally perfect ! and the social criticism of the film is also very well elaborated, when you discover the meaning of the ""bad smell"" and the ""divider line"" the film gets absolutely better ! but I just can't accept the end of ki-jung …"

5,2024.07.25,"A fantastic and thrilling watch. After watching it once with my father, we sat again mere months later to rewatch, and it was 100% worth it! The movie is extremely gritty and smart, comedy is perfectly timed and I grew to fell in love with the characters. Not a moment of screentime is wasted, and it definitely deserves more recognition. A fantastic ending, a fantastic movie. Kept me hooked the whole way through!"

5,2024.07.01,"Masterful in a fashion rarely seen in many movies, 'Parasite' is the only film I know where I couldn't imagine it without the wild tonal change."
0.5,2024.07.01,Next......not a good movie
5,2024.06.24,Parasite is a visual masterpiece.
2.5,2024.06.20,"For me this movie did not live up to the hype. How were the Parks, the rich upperclass family, responsible for any of the madness that ensues when they come into contact with despicable Kims? The critics think that this film brilliantly explores the nuances between opposite social classes. I think it was all just rather vapid and pointless."
3,2024.06.18,"Glad to see a foreign film get nominated and win (even though they have their own category). I’m fairly familiar with Korean drama, but for the virgin Kdrama viewer this may have seemed cheesy. I enjoyed the film, aside from that slight cheesiness that is common in Korean film/television. It was darker that typical Korean fare, and the ending was bizarre. This wouldn’t have been my pick for best picture. Too many other great choices this year."
5,2024.06.17,9.1/10 That's it. That's my entire review.
2,2024.06.05,"Even though I like to watch Korean movies, there's a few I like a lot, with this one I didn't clicked at all. It seemed like I've seen it all before. OK, I get the point but its nothing close to groundbreaking and certainly not worth of all the praise it got."
4.5,2024.06.05,just Awesome. The plot the characters the theme. Its uniqueness
5,2024.06.04,"Great film, would describe as a dramatic psychological thriller. The characters and character dynamics really shine in this film and you end up feeling for both families."
4.5,2024.05.29,Wonderful and interesting
4.5,2024.05.28,"It was a bit strange, but despite this was very interesting, pretty uncomfortable and inspiration giving. Also I am not a fan of Korean movies, I may have misunderstood some ideas, don't know."
0.5,2024.05.23,"Not dubbed, never going to officially be dubbed. I stopped watching subbed media a long time ago, I dont want to miss any detail in the background or expression on a face. For that reason, the director's choice, the film is unwatchable."
4.5,2024.05.22,"Perfection in narrative, performance, and direction— Parasite will eat you alive."
5,2024.05.18,"I started watching thinking it would be boring, but it surprised me! Great movie! In the end, I applauded by myself."
5,2024.05.14,Complex ideas crafted to perfection!
2.5,2024.05.06,"I understand the movie refers to the social gap. I really do. But for someone who's already aware of this, the plot makes much ado about nothing? Sure there's a little suspense with the basement, but that's about it. I truly did not see the hype on this movie, as a movie buff as well. I watched it in all subtitles, but I don't think that's what killed the experience for me. The plot felt, nonsensical, or rather, inconsequential. The script didn't have any standouts. The character relationships or other character tropes weren't anything special. The only interesting point was seeing how rich people, aren't really aware of their riches, or how other people might look at them / strive to be like them. Is that truly indicative of a bigger scale or just a piece of these characters, who knows."
5,2024.05.01,Outstanding. The pinnacle of dark humour with a few philosophical moments. A must-see.
5,2024.04.23,"Filme tocante, com várias críticas sociais, mostrando como o capitalismo esmaga as pessoas que não conseguem ter renda alta, e que por suas necessidades acabam cometendo infrações. Vale a pena demais assistir a esse longa, indispensável nos dias atuais."
5,2024.04.22,"Parasita é um clássico instantâneo, o melhor filme do século 21 e um dos melhores de todos os tempos!"
5,2024.04.21,"Bong's masterful writing and direction is evident in this magnum opus clashing entertainment, intrigue, thrill, criticism in our society, and leaving you emotionally hollowed."
4,2024.04.20,"Didn't expect it to have this kind of plot, but still a good movie"
4.5,2024.04.17,"""Parasite"" stands as a cinematic tour de force, a searing indictment of the socioeconomic disparities entrenched within Korean society. Director Bong Joon-ho masterfully crafts a narrative that pulsates with tension, expertly weaving together themes of class struggle and human desperation. The film's chaotic energy is palpable from start to finish, ensnaring viewers in its gripping tale of deceit and survival. At its core, ""Parasite"" presents a scathing critique of the cavernous divide between the haves and the have-nots, as the destitute Kim family infiltrates the affluent Park household through a web of deception. Each twist and turn in the plot serves to intensify the film's relentless momentum, leaving audiences on the edge of their seats as they grapple with the moral ambiguities laid bare before them. What truly sets ""Parasite"" apart is its ability to provoke introspection long after the credits have rolled. The film's rich tapestry of characters and layered narrative demand multiple viewings, each unveiling new depths to explore and dissect. Bong Joon-ho's directorial prowess shines brightly, infusing every frame with a sense of urgency and unease that lingers in the mind. In the end, ""Parasite"" transcends the confines of its genre, emerging as a profound meditation on the human condition and the corrosive effects of inequality. It is a cinematic experience that demands to be rewatched, its impact only deepening with each subsequent viewing. In a landscape inundated with mediocrity, ""Parasite"" stands as a beacon of artistic excellence—a film that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on cinema for years to come."
3.5,2024.04.15,"pretty good movie, not my kind of thing but i still liked it"
5,2024.04.13,I love everything about this movie. Definitely my number 1 favorite film of all time.
2.5,2024.04.12,"Mid. This movie has bland characters that are just archetypes for the story which in itself is quite basic, tragically. I'm certain that if this movie was made in the US, the acclaim would have been lower than it is now. There are better classism stories out there, this ain't it."
5,2024.04.08,"This is a heavy story, with conflicting people all over the spectrum of the society. It's a hard mirror for us to look, and an amazing movie."
5,2024.04.07,"I watched this with my son Beebert. He was traumatized and did not understand anything because I had it in Korean because I know Korean but he doesn't and has to learn. Beebert was not enthused by the amount of social commentary in this movie, and left to go watch Wild Kratts. That does not matter, I am the only one that matters."
5,2024.04.07,One of the best films I've seen in my life.
5,2024.04.05,"A masterfully crafted film that expertly blends genres, seamlessly transitioning between comedy, drama, and thriller elements. Bong Joon Ho's direction is superb, as he skilfully builds tension and suspense while also infusing the narrative with biting social commentary."
4,2024.04.05,I love it when movies are this original and fun to watch! It came apart a little bit in the end though.
4.5,2024.04.01,"The consagration for a great filmmaker, getting the worldwide recognition he deserved after a series of magnificent work; even taking home 4 Oscars for himself with this, one of the greatest non-english language movies of the 21st Century, if not of all-time."
1.5,2024.03.30,"Super boring, I wasn't even paying attention until the ending and every part of the movie was very clear to me, so simple and a boring dialogues"
4,2024.03.30,"An immaculately crafted and riveting tale of class divide told with an interesting story, strong performances, and beautiful cinematography."
5,2024.03.27,"It's the best movie, It shows how the class gap can bring a person to the border of madness and how much our words can affect the life of others"
3,2024.03.25,"The first 80 minutes is a boring drawn out predictable track of over explaining the rational to fire everyone. The metaphors are ham fisted. These movies about people being people start to suck after awhile when you deal with people being people 5 days a week. It's a social satire great, it's not saying anything that hasn't already got me down in the past."
5,2024.03.20,"There's nothing about Parasite that hasn't already been said, it truly is an amazing piece of work and deserves all the praise it gets. Plenty of other films have expressed the same social criticisms, but it's the exploration of human desperation with extreme authenticity and realism that is so haunting. It's disturbing, yet brilliant, and is what really makes standout, it exposes the inequalities between social classes, and how it brings out the worst in everyone."
4,2024.03.16,Inesperado. Diferente. Filme surpreendente.
1,2024.03.11,Pretentious weebs like to overstate how good it is.
4.5,2024.03.09,"It begins with a family of four from the lower class in Korean society: a father, mother, eldest son, and younger sister. Both parents are unemployed, and the children did not continue their education. They all lived in a basement room, but then suddenly it was like heaven had given a big blessing to this family. When the eldest brother's friend has to study abroad, So he entrusted him to teach English to a rich man's daughter. However, this apparent stroke of luck eventually leads to unforeseen disaster. And this is the first movie in 92 years of the Oscars to be the winner of this award. It is a non-English-language film. It's undeniable this movie is famous and popularity because of the outstanding cinematography and unforgettable characters. First of all, I will talk about the best scenes that impressed and fascinated me while watching this movie. The scene of walking down the stairs to return to the Mouse Hole home while it rains occurs after the Parasitic family has to escape from the paradise they have only recently enjoyed. The Kim family ran home to save as much of their belongings as possible. After watching that scene made me feel like it reflects society that rich people are at a high point and can take the heart of a crisis, but poor people must overcome their own obstacles. Then, during the conversation with the lady during a phone call, she talked about something that made Kim Ki Taek stop. This is another scene that makes me feel that no matter what class or society you belong to, you will be criticized, looked down on, oppressed, and cynical by someone higher than you anyway. While all the actors in the film deserve praise for their performances, Kim Ki Taek's character, portrayed by Song Kang Ho stands out of the narrative. I really love him because, he is the main characters that makes the story fun, hilarious, tense, and thrilling at the same time. He made the story colorful and not too stressful. I agree that some characters may detract from the main plot. Therefore, time doesn't seem fluid and it takes time to watch it several times to understand that point. Transitioning to the architectural symbolism employed by the creator. The stark class divide is clearly expressed in the design of the Park family's home It has a raised entrance and clearly delineated glass edges. This suggests that the production is highlighting socio-economic differences. To reinforce the main issue of inequality. Moving on to the movie's overall impact, I enjoyed with many emotions and perspectives, but the things that make this movie win so many awards and praise are the analysis and solving of each case and the clear satire of life. If anyone likes this kind of movie, it's certainly one worth watching."
5,2024.03.07,"Una obra maestra. Cinco estrellas totales. Una película sensacional, bastante argentina en varios aspectos."
4.5,2024.03.04,"The gold standard of what every ""eat the rich"" satire wants to be"
5,2024.02.26,"This movie was the best i ever wathced in my life, from story telling to camera shots. Just one thing, the movie ending would be more intresting if the son from poor family when he got hit by the rock, developed some pshihological problems and top that there was kinda lack of conflic bethen poor family dauther and his ""studient"""
4,2024.02.25,Very deep and refreshingly original. Loved it.
5,2024.02.23,I ABSOLUTOOTLY LOVE IT
5,2024.02.23,Melhor filme que já foi feito já história da humanidade! Até os dias de hoje.
3.5,2024.02.18,"Although vastly overrated, 기생충 starts with a very creative idea, supported by lovable performances. Unfortunately, it soon falls apart due to the Korean adagium that some super unrealistic thing absolutely MUST happen to keep a movie from being boring, and as soon as the film takes that turn, there's really nowhere for it to go but an uninspired conclusion."
4.5,2024.01.31,"The acting in this movie is acceptable and we accept all the characters, but in terms of structure, narrative, mise-en-scène and framing, this movie is very good. I think the director knows what he wants and knows how to show it, and this is the art of directing."
5,2024.01.23,Great storytelling! One of my faves..
5,2024.01.21,This film was genius and it deserved all the awards it received.
5,2024.01.17,"After you watch this film, ask yourself who the titular parasite is! As a lower-class family integrates themselves with an upper class family, the lies and deceit begin to bite them back as they discover something that throws everything into disarray. Bringing up themes of class and high society, this is a film that'll leave you shocked and very unnerved!"
4,2024.01.15,"A pretty good movie. Though I think it's a little overrated. The story is interesting, the chacters on the other side are rather one-dimensional and boring."
5,2024.01.12,"Great movie, great actors no doubt, a weird end."
4.5,2024.01.11,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
5,2024.01.10,Demands to be seen with as little advanced knowledge as possible because this will allow you fully appreciate how gradually Bong Joon Ho moves the plot from farce to something else.
5,2024.01.05,Social-class opener! We All know that social class is prevalent in society but this movie shows how unaware the upper class is to the Lower classes and the struggles they face or how irrelevant it is to them unless it directly affects them.
3.5,2024.01.04,Decent movie the story was good but the plot was predictable. some odd scenes that felt unbelievable. not sure why its a 99 or got so much praise. movie is soo mid
5,2023.12.31,Amazing cast. Thoroughly enjoyable and powerful. I didn't quite get the meaning behind the ending but still liked this movie very much.
5,2023.12.21,one of the best movies of this decade. hands down. will rewatch an infinite amount of times
3.5,2023.12.20,"This film is absolutely thrilling, engaging, and contains elements that will grip you throughout its entirety. However, I think there are far better movies from South Korea that I myself have seen recently such as ""A moment to remember,"" & ""Past lives."" They might not be of the same genre, but the previously stated films, mainly ""A moment to remember,"" deserves to be equally acclaimed of not more. Despite lacking thrilling aspects, which most of the time is what forces us to be glued on our sofa expecting every upcoming moments, these movies rely on romance, interesting stories, and subtly reveal concepts that we rarely stumble upon on most movies and series being released these days. The actors are impeccably competent, the excellency of the cinematography is unimaginable, and the sets display visually appealing areas of the Asian continent. This is an area that I think ""Parasite"" must have capitalized on. Gladly, they saved the whole thing with twists and turns, mainly one that makes the 2h12 worth your time."
4.5,2023.12.08,"Saw this in the theater when it came out and then saw it again two days ago. Excellent portrait of rich and poor and, as always with Korean cinema, the innate flaws of humanity and pitfalls of an infinitely imperfect universe. Sometimes the morally superior position is unoccupied because, given the tools the characters have been assigned in life, the morally superior position is exceedingly difficult to compute and/or attain."
5,2023.12.03,"""It keeps clinging to me"" Parasite will be remembered for generations. Every frame is a painting and, despite its harrowing depiction of the damages of classism, a shared struggle emerges which is, simply put, human. Anyway, fun stuff!"
4.5,2023.11.22,Excellent. It really deserves the Oskar.
4,2023.11.22,just the scene after the flood is sufficient for this movie to be one of my favorite movies of all time.
4,2023.11.06,"Parasita é um filme que brinca com o público ao construir um enredo bem desenhado e dinâmico, e surpreende o telespectador com o resultado das ações dos personagens. Super indico"
5,2023.11.03,100 % of tomatoes with all the profound abyss of mankind; best film of 2019
5,2023.11.02,"In my opinion, a great movie needs: -to keep you entertained with a gripping, original story -interesting, well-rounded characters that develop over the course of the movie -to be thought-provoking, and stay with you long after you've watched it Parasite delivers on all points, in spades."
5,2023.10.29,Amazing movie. Genius. So well made. Tells a great story. I wanna rewatch.
4.5,2023.10.29,"So kids, the lesson today is when a family member asks you to help them invade someone's life, leech off of their success, and eventually get them killed by a deranged old man, you say ""no, why would you do that?"""
5,2023.10.22,"Sadique, palpitant, thrillant, parfait. Du début à la fin, ce film est un chef-d'oeuvre."
5,2023.10.02,"Amazing, visual art, story, lighting, camera walk….. everything is perfect. It show the line of top and bottom peoples in every way in movie."
5,2023.09.03,Fantastic movie. It Felt as if it was a perfect film.
3,2023.09.03,"""Parasite"" is wild. It's perhaps the most wild film I've ever seen. The story is compelling. (And there really are two or three stories in the film.) It's also really imaginative. However, at times, it's just not enjoyable. Even if you like genres under which the film falls."
4,2023.09.03,Great movie. I can assure you the parasite does not include the mind virus that plagues the west.
4.5,2023.08.31,"Parasite is definitely a ""must see"" film in 2019, and is often regarded as Bong Joon-ho's most influential masterpiece of a black-comedy, who also directed the acclaimed films such as Snowpiercer, Okja, Memories of Murder, and The Host, and the first Korean film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. This plot centers about the unemployed destitute Kim clan who pretend to be highly-qualified individuals by infiltrating the wealthy Park family.."
5,2023.08.29,"Un chef d'oeuvre qui a prit du temps à murir en moi, mais vraiment aujourd'hui je ne peux m'empêcher de le comparer à tous les autres films, qui me semblent être de la même veine."
5,2023.08.23,Genuinely amazing story with deep economic meanings yet scary and disturbing.
5,2023.08.19,"Incredibly smart and detailed screenwriting and direction. The build up is a ride that keeps getting higher and higher until it eventually starts to drop into chilling thrills and it delivers more than expected. Well crafted climaxes. It feels pretty insane and dramatic, but it still knows how to be humourous. The cinematography and music is fantastic and highlights the storytelling very well, while the cast is brilliant and convincing on their part during the whole act. The editing is very clever and engaging. The use and timing of the slow motion dramatizes scenes just perfect. The script is flawless. The sets compliment the narrative and create a great contrasts between the two families. The flooding scene looked pretty good, including the explosive toilet. There's seemingly no scene that feels out of place. Nothing in this movie went to waste. A masterpiece."
5,2023.08.18,One of my all-time favorites. The first movie I paid to see a second time.
5,2023.08.08,I've never seen a movie like this. Awesome
5,2023.08.07,A truly perfect film. Great themes about social classes while also being entertaining throughout.
5,2023.08.03,"This movie is so good holy, I ve never seen anything like it, and its good. Its got a lot of soul, the performances are amazing, the shots are extreordinary, the pacing is nearing perfection, I dont know what else to say, i m amazed. Wow. Big ups"
5,2023.07.31,This move is a masterpiece!!!
4.5,2023.07.27,I disagree with most of the film's premise but find it hilarious and affecting all the same - would be nice if modern audiences could understand that this is very achievable. Not everything has to be us vs them.
5,2023.07.26,"One of the first real/serious films of Hollywood I watched. It's the one and only movie that always comes to mind when someone asks ""What are your 10 top movies?"". Do not even bother reading reviews, watch it and see for yourself."
4.5,2023.07.21,"One of the most unique, thrilling, suspenseful, bone-chilling, edge-of-your-seat movies in not just this decade. but of all time."
3.5,2023.07.16,I did not love it but I liked it very much
5,2023.06.28,One of the Best Films of All Time.
3,2023.06.28,I liked it but didn’t love it. I thought the story was interesting but not that exciting. It was fun to watch the family work together but it wasn’t my favorite. Not a best picture imo
4,2023.06.27,A fresh and original story that moves along at a steady and well-balanced pace with more than a couple surprises along the way.
3.5,2023.06.18,"This is s very good movie. What makes it so is it presents very complex relationships in a simplified, limited sets environment. There is an intimacy to the proceedings, and this augments the comedic aspect as well. The acting is efficient and effective. The one drawback is the two dimensional characters; presented as absolute versions of rich and poor. In other words, you're either on this side or that side. That is not to say that there are not people that act and think this way. It all seems very convenient and you can predict character reactions. There is no warmth or sympathy between the families. No personal connections, with everyone being disposable and blind to one another. They pursue their own self interests without ethics or morality. Either a hustler or very gullible. However, as a black comedy this can work and it does so throughout the movie. It is a movie that must be thought about, considering each layer like Matryoshka Dolls. Class interactions causing intra-class dichotomies and violence. A very harsh movie on its own characters. I have watched it more than once. I pick up something new or a new idea about the film with each viewing. Exactly the effect a thinking movie should have on its audience."
4,2023.06.17,"A great original story, solid acting, and shocking twists and turns make Parasite a highly entertaining movie. Easily weaving in its themes of class inequality, Parasite makes for a thought-provoking drama while still being interesting to watch."
4.5,2023.06.16,An absolutely fantastic film with a great unique original story that is only held back from perfection because I wanted the family to continue to get away with what they were getting away with.
4.5,2023.06.15,"A clever, original story that intertwines drama, comedy and thriller elements brilliantly along with a heavy dose of social commentary."
3.5,2023.06.11,Interesant pana accelereaza tamp spre final
5,2023.06.09,It kept getting better and better.
5,2023.06.08,Best Korean movie of all time.
5,2023.06.08,"The first half of the film is darkly humorous, with a family living in a basement lying and framing the driver and housekeeper in an effort to work for the rich. When I saw the first half, I thought it was supposed to be a comedy. Until they see rich people go camping, but the Jin family actually live in the mansion, eat and drink, and completely consider themselves rich. It makes me uncomfortable to see this because it is ""greed"". They want to make money. That's normal. But to enjoy a life of utter hypocrisy is ""greed"". Seeing the heavy rain, I thought the host family would come back. The good part of the movie is the return of the old butler. The turning point of the film is the scene leading to the basement. From this moment on, this is no longer a comedy. It became a conspiracy, a bigger lie, a fight for life. I thought that the Jin family has parasitic in the rich family, did not think that the old housekeeper and her husband is a bigger parasite. After watching this movie, I always wonder what I would have done if I was living in a basement, working for a rich man. I will definitely work hard to make money, change a better house, and then through this job to find a better job for myself. That should be most people's plan. The Jin family, although very smart, also very good at work. But they are lazy, do not make progress, do not have a plan, and do not seek to change the status quo. So they would rather be parasites and feel inferior than change the status quo. The lesson of this film is that if you are not satisfied with your life, you must find a way to improve the quality of your life, because you can!"
3,2023.06.01,"It was entertaining but not mind-blowingly good as many western critics indicated. Part of the confusion is caused by western critics who seem to be evaluating the plot's shock value based on a European/western 3-act structure instead of the 4-act Asian structure. This movie plot follows the latter and is consistent with the timing and expected twists and turns of that structure. After accounting for the 4-act structure, this plot is not as shocking or surprising as western critics seem to think. Instead, it takes the expected twists & turns in the expected order, which reduces its shock value. Still, it's an entertaining way to pass a few hours."
5,2023.05.25,"Parasite is unique, funny, relentless, nerve racking and deeply earnest. The juxtaposing themes and visual staging unveils a climax that will leave the audience shocked and thrilled."
0.5,2023.05.19,Hard to watch. Seems to be glorifying class warfare. Not good
5,2023.05.10,"GG Bong Joon-Ho, please direct my life"
4.5,2023.05.09,"Bit too dark for my taste but deserving of best picture in the oscars great movie all around a must see, so good!"
5,2023.05.07,"Hilarious, genius, heartbreaking."
5,2023.05.02,This movie is absolutly masterpiece
5,2023.04.22,One of the best movies I've ever seen. You cannot miss this one.
3,2023.04.14,"Good, but overrated. Didn't deserve best picture, Jo Jo Rabbit was better"
2.5,2023.04.10,Well it's Oscar nominated so that means it's sht. So average that you want to scream. Don't pay money for it but watch it so you can say you did.
4,2023.04.03,Trump brought me here. Im not into reading subtitles but have no regrets watching this well deserved Oscar worthy
3.5,2023.04.01,"It's good, but I do not know if I like it. Not sure how I feel about this, it's very simbolic and has something to say and it's an incredible thing but I don't dig it, don't know how to explain it too."
3.5,2023.04.01,"Overrated is the operative word. This is a year that gave us Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 1917, JoJo Rabbit, all of which I believe were far stronger accomplishments. Regardless of that, this is a good film, at times very good, but there's nothing that merits the hoopla other than a foreign film being the the esoteric darling of that year's Hollywood cultural mentality about cultural mentalities. Parasite isn't worth vaccinating against, but its overactive accolades were a bit pestilential."
5,2023.03.28,"Awesome. There are no good guys or bad guys. Everyone is equally Parasite & equally Host. Quite brilliant on nearly every level from story to humor to thriller elements to acting to cinematic craft. I didn't expect to like this movie, yet once it was finished exclaimed, ""that might be the best movie I've ever seen."" Do not go into it with those type of expectations & avoid knowing too much about it beforehand. It's great movie & one of my favorites."
4.5,2023.03.22,This is an intense movie. It's almost like 2 genres in one.
1,2023.03.20,Best picture? Good grief. Bleh.
5,2023.03.15,"Hands down, one of my top 5 movies of all time."
5,2023.03.12,"In a world of cgi superhero rubbish, this stands out as one of the best films of modern cinema"
5,2023.03.06,"If any creation is able to make an unforgettable imprint of what needs changing in this world, that production has fully achieved it's purpose. Through precise acting by the cast the movie imposingly justifies the desperation of the neglected. A well written story with imaginativeness of the highest quality. Excellent visual effects and use of colour tones to portray the decaying of the society's core. Excellent design of characters capturing many traits of personalities. There's alot to gather from this movie and what's truly interesting when it's viewers turn to decide who the real parasites of the society are."
4.5,2023.02.27,"If you're one of those spectators that do not have any problem reading the subtitles, you'd find out a well acted, crafted, edited, movie with a surprise twist worth of the academy award."
3,2023.02.18,"It was OK. Not too interesting, the whole movie I was waiting for something to happen"
4.5,2023.02.18,I thought this movie was fantastic. A human story of class tragedy and horror.
5,2023.02.16,"A masterpiece in filmmaking. Parasite is a thrill ride, never revealing where it's truly going until the bitter, pulse-pounding end."
5,2023.02.14,Probably going down as a classic
5,2023.02.07,I can't even explain
5,2023.02.04,"Loved every aspect of this movie, appreciate that the story is well-written and has a solid premise. You can tell that a lot of work went into making this film. Both the acting and the cinematography were excellent.  Contains many lovely symbolisms and touches on issues such as wealth and inequality. There is just so much about this movie that I enjoy."
5,2023.02.01,"Great film and story with amazing shots! Also, one of the best endings I've ever seen!"
5,2023.01.14,Watched this in theaters great from start to end
4.5,2022.12.24,"When I first viewed ""Parasite"" I thought it to be wildly overrated. But upon my second viewing I absorb the storyline much better. Maybe I was in a better frame of mine. Parasite joins my top 10 movies of the 21st century, along with ""Children of Men,"" ""The Two Towers,"" ""Judas and the Black Messiah,"" ""Top Gun: Maverick,"" ""Casino Royale,"" ""The Incredibles."" ""Carol,"" ""Get Out,"" and ""Don't Look Up."" ""Soul"" moved to number 11."
5,2022.11.27,"The director of the film knows what he is doing. In addition to addressing social issues, he manages to create really important characters and an ingenious and simply amazing plot, which leaves the viewer more and more suffocated and involved in the story. The film is perfect, in my opinion."
5,2022.11.27,"The best movie ever made, especially internationally! With the best acting ever by an ensemble! Plus, the best directing from Joon-ho Bong! Also, the best movie screenplay ever written! As well as the best editing ever done in a movie! And the best production design ever made in a movie!"
5,2022.11.14,"With a brilliant mix of genres, Parasite manages to touch, surprise, frighten and chuckle with flawless acting, immaculate cinematography and a deeply enthralling story that honors its audience proving Bong Joon-ho's masterful command in the art of filmmaking."
5,2022.11.13,"This is one of my favorite movies and I'm often hard to impress. Today, I watched this movie and had no idea what to expect. It was a twisted, hilarious masterpiece of cinema. It had my heart beating. I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Anyone who's a movie geek like me has to watch this."
2,2022.10.28,"A tedious mediocrity for a so called ""masterpiece"", Parasite is one of those movies you go into expecting a walk on the red carpet experience especially for a Critic Apprentice like me none of over sort happened and snacks were not provided so I had to begrudgingly hark over $20 for a popcorn. Surely this couldn't get any worse but as the light went dim and the projector starting whirling I stared in pure baffling awe as the movie wasn't even in English no seriously who would have left such a grave technical error in the final product. I had to squint and read the tiny text at the bottom surely damped my mood. This movie was only made to hate on rich people which is insensitive because they are only using the fruits of their labor to live their everyday lives. I find it Ironic that these ""top critics"" shower this movie with praise when they themselves are money hungry worms, how upsetting.,"
5,2022.10.22,A breathtaking and different film from South Korean cinema about the class gap...
4.5,2022.10.19,"La trama es interesante, muy disfrutable, la escenografía perfecta, buenas fotografías, actuación excelente. Aunque el final se siente un poco sobre expuesto y apresurado."
5,2022.10.11,"Director Bong Joon Ho has always been preoccupied with socioeconomic disparity, but he takes it to an entirely different level with Parasite. When the impoverished Kim family cleverly inserts itself into the wealthy Park family, life for both families spirals out of control, resulting in unimaginable chaos and horror. Parasite is a film truly unlike any other, an ingeniously plotted nightmare that works as both an art film and entertainment for the masses. Bong Joon Ho, a master of visuals, frames and blocks every shot meticulously. Humor is perfectly balanced with suspense, all while remaining faithful to his theme. Parasite is one of the best films of the 21st century, if not the best."
5,2022.09.23,"Tenso e intrigante, o filme me surpreendeu. super recomendo"
5,2022.09.21,Um dos melhores filmes de todos os tempos.
5,2022.09.13,One of the most original movie I’ve seen in a long time. The Oscar was well deserved
3.5,2022.09.11,This movie was entertaining through out and kept me engaged from beginning to end. My favorite Bong Jooh-ho film and in my opinion his best to date. It still has its faults and seems a bit preachy at times but I still really liked/enjoyed the movie.
4.5,2022.09.06,a very good but not absolutely incredible movie. uses symbolism the most very well. very good storytelling through visuals
2.5,2022.09.05,"Among movies that will be in the running for the Oscars 2020, the most interesting is the achievement of Korean director Bong Joon-Hu, not because of some special quality and originality, but because of the marked overestimation given to him by both lay audiences and from modern critics. Please note that the writer of these lines is not one of the experts of Korean films, nor was he ever interested in being one. On the other hand, Bong Joon-Hu became an international creator with his excellent Snowpiercer from 2013, so the criteria should be in line with that fact. The film is at first indisputably interesting to watch, drinkable, extraordinarily driven. It is placed between comedy, drama and thriller, intelligently refusing to classify itself, as well as engaging in a deeper understanding of social problems, avoiding to take sides with either of the two families portrayed in the film from the two ends of the social ladder, so that it cleverly made the culmination as interesting as possible. It will undoubtedly be awarded with some Oscars, except for acting, because there is no reason for that. But there is also no reason to emphasize the over-originality of the story itself, ie. screenplay, because the critics seem to have forgotten the masterpiece of the 1964 French director and screenwriter Rene Clement's ""Joy House"" (aka ""The Cage of Love"") with Alain Delon and Jane Fonda. The main thrust of Joon-Hu's film is taken from the title, with the motives and plot of the love affair being transferred to the social sphere, which of course is so modern today, but in that case it is somewhat hypocritical not to give a simultaneous and deeper analysis, for the sake of mere viewability and commercial reasons. Also, in addition to the many other banalities used in the plot, communicating with the Morse Code as presented in the film could also include it in science fiction genre. Since Hollywood has not been bothered by originality before (just remember the ""contribution"" in directing of the 2015 award-winning plagiarism ""The Revenant""), there is no reason not to repeat the situation again this year."
4.5,2022.09.03,"shocking to see so many korean actors in a korean film of course, where's your diversity ? The film was very good with interesting social commentary, but I did find it a little absurd in places and the ending wasn't for me"
4.5,2022.09.02,"This is a tense and somewhat unsettling film, which is thrilling and claustrophobic at times. Its certainly a multi-layered plot that builds up slowly. I wouldn't want to say anymore so as not to provide any potential spoilers. Its not clear from the start what's going to happen and it's a film that's likely enjoyed more if you don't have too many pre-conceptions. Its certainly quite a memorable film. I wouldn't say it's the most thought provoking film I've ever seen by any means but it is pretty thoughtful, in terms of the general societal themes covered. I would certainly recommend it if your keen on world cinema and like to watch films that keep you guessing."
5,2022.08.29,"Der Film ist eine Mischung von Schauspiel, Thriller, Gleichnis, Posse, Karikatur und Komödie. Und spielt das soziale Ungleichgewicht in Süd-Korea und sogleich der Welt an. Bong Joon-ho schrieb das Drehbuch mit Han Jin-won, und sogleich führte auch Bong Joon-ho die Regie. Der Film ist perfekt inszeniert, er ist mit spürbarer Liebe ausgestattet, und mit Können gestaltet. Selbst die Filmmusik ist mit Modernen und Klassischen Elementen bestückt. Für mich ist der Film mit seinen Darstellern in aller Hinsicht Perfekt und des Lobes würdig, ein Genuss für die Augen und für die Ohren."
4,2022.08.17,"Filme legal pra caralho, gostei de como a família conseguiu os empregos com a família rica, e gostei do mini plot twist no final do filme, só achei o ruim a garota de morrido com uma facada só, e o garoto ter ficado vivo por causa da pedrada na cabeça, mas acho que a garota era para ficar viva no filme. Mas de resto, eu recomendo muito esse filme, vale a pena assistir, mas não sei se merecia o Oscar."
5,2022.08.15,One of the best movies I’ve ever seen.
5,2022.08.15,"A haunting pitch black comedy that thoroughly skewers the dog eat dog world of capitalism. It leaves you feeling lost in the fog of who the real parasite is: the poor who must violently contend against each other and fight dirty for a chance to suckle off the teat of the rich, or the rich who are infantilized by their own wealth into a selfish helplessness on which they survive off the labors of those they keep in destitution. The twists kept me on the edge of my seat, while the dark humor rubbed salt in my wounds. All of this brings you to an ending so bleak, it highlights the faults in a system where the only way to live is without direction, as any plan is folly in the face of where you are born under capitalism."
1.5,2022.08.14,"Parasite is like a Boeing 777 taking off vertically, soaring high, losing velocity, and falling to earth in a raging fireball. In other words, I've seldom been so impressed by the first 3 acts of a movie, or so let down by the last 2. What makes the movie initially so charming is the crisp, fairy-tale structure of the plot, offering glimmers of hope that maybe, just maybe, filmmakers have rediscovered the art of storytelling. The Kim family's takeover of a palatial hillside home, or at least the downstairs bit, is a joy to behold. It follows relentless patterns of connivance and insinuation, as when the old housekeeper is let go for seeming to stain a handkerchief with tubercular blood. No problem: Mrs. Kim, with a helpful reference from a daughter posing as an ""art therapist,"" is right on hand to fill the spot. Despite the folktale vibe, there's plenty of nuance too. We are not invited to simply pity the destitute Kims or to despise the complacent Parks. Somewhere midway through, Mr. Kim shares his life's store of wisdom with his son: planning things out is a waste of time, and whatever happens, happens. What can you do? With such a patriarch, it's not hard to see how the Kims have made themselves desperately poor. Equally reprehensible is the Kims' outlook toward the Parks, whom they dehumanize as gullible marks. Meanwhile, the Parks are presented as clean, organized, and essentially decent. Mrs. Park, despite her emotional imbalance, is particularly winsome, and you flinch when the Kims call her an idiot behind her back. Unfortunately, all of this nuance is lost by the end. Other reviews have pointed out the richly metaphorical nature of the movie, but I would add that the metaphors fall like a rain of bricks. In seeing Mr. Kim, hired as a chauffeur, forced to don an Indian headdress for a birthday party, we are to associate him with the oppressed peoples of the world. In seeing his neighborhood flooded with sewage after heavy rains, we are to understand that the very structure of the world keeps him wallowing in filth. And when, while Mrs. Park is driven on a lengthy shopping tour, we see her feet stretched toward the front seat alongside Mr. Kim's face, we are to gather that he is at the family's mercy. This kind of ham-fistedness reveals the severe limits of socialist comprehension; it cannot really get at the human condition. When the story ends in a bloodbath, you know it's gone off the rails in a bad way. It's not merely the loss of structure or the conflation of genres that bothers me; it's the draining of expansiveness and humanity."
4.5,2022.08.11,"The direction, the cinematography and the visual messages in general are just incredible well-done. The story is perfectly constructed, making this both a really dynamic and deep film."
5,2022.08.08,"WOW! Easily one of the best films I've ever seen. A must watch. Its a comedy, drama, and thriller all roled into one. Amazing story telling and character development. If you haven't seen it, cancel your plans and watch it tonight."
3.5,2022.08.08,"good drama, lot's of symbolism, witch i love."
1,2022.08.07,A movie that glorifies stealing from and killing of honest folks. It worries me that this sad ultra-left fetish received such high praise.
5,2022.08.03,"The overall high level of quality is very apparent, the movie is excellently staged, shot and directed. The story also moves at a very efficient pace, it's fast but every scene adds to the story, and it slows down when it needs to. Parasite is truly gripping, partially due to its structure, and it uses both humor, and tension expertly. The films message is clearly conveyed, not only through the characters and their actions, but also very much through the cinematography. There are some nice dichotomies that separate rich and poor – light and dark, clean and dirty, and high and low."
4,2022.07.17,"8.4 - Seamless transitions from light hearted comedy to tragic, real moments. Great use of metaphor but not my best picture of the year"
5,2022.07.16,"Parasite is one of the few movies you will find where I don't have a single critique to give. From start to finish the experience keeps you hooked with an innovative plot that was acted perfectly by the cast. It's well deserving of its acclaim and deserves your attention for one sitting, without a doubt one of the best films, not just of 2019, but to ever be created. Bravo Bong Joon Ho, bravo"
2.5,2022.07.11,"5.0/10 — ""Poor""/""Inferior""/""Amateurish"" -(Seen on 7/10/22)"
5,2022.06.28,"La película perfecta para cerrar la década. Esta joya de suspenso y comedia negra surcoreana dirigida por el casi visionario Bong Joon-ho, es más que solo la mejor película de 2019, es un fenómeno sensacional de la industria. Saltando de un género al otro, ""Parasite"" (2019) realmente sorprende con su inteligente humor, reflexión ante los temas de interacciones y clases sociales, y dándole una vuelta de tuerca a la trama un par de veces. Las emociones de la película adoptan nuevos grados de intensidad por minuto (el pulso cardiaco también), apoyando todos los géneros que representa, así como paralelamente los temas preocupantes que hay en su escena. Sus numerosas nominaciones a los Óscar aseguran su título como futuro clásico, principalmente por el logro de ser la primera película de idioma no ingles que gana el premio a Mejor Película. Este es un tipo bienvenido de parásito que no se va de mi cabeza, y creo que muchas personas que la vieron van a estar de acuerdo al respecto."
5,2022.06.25,"I sat down to watch this movie with my dad, who has poor eyesight, can't read subtitles very quickly, and usually falls asleep halfway through movies. He was riveted throughout the whole movie. The plot is so satisfying and suspenseful. The climax was upsetting and really made me think. There is so much to analyze about this movie. The ending was so perfect too."
5,2022.06.24,"With a brilliant mix of genres, Parasite manages to touch, surprise, frighten and chuckle with flawless acting, immaculate cinematography and a deeply enthralling story that honors its audience proving Bong Joon-ho's masterful command in the art of filmmaking."
2,2022.06.21,"This is a mediocre movie. I didn't enjoy it at all—it was just weird. Not funny, and not satisfying. Very violent. Worst Best Picture winner I have ever seen by far."
5,2022.06.18,"""Parasite"" captures you from start to finish. It's engaging, thought-provoking with its premise, captivating with its performances and music score, and somehow manages to handle the tones of humour, drama, mystery, thriller suspense without them conflicting, all wrapped into one film. One of the best of the decade, and a well-deserved Oscar win."
2.5,2022.06.15,"What an interesting movie. I don't really know what to think of it, to be honest, that's why I gave it a 2.5 out of 5. It had an interesting plot at the beginning with them all taking over the house but it began to get gruesome and weird towards the end. The ending was just crazy. I don't know if I would recommend this movie or if it is as great as everyone makes it out to be."
4.5,2022.06.13,A masterwork in storytelling and shifting tones.
2,2022.06.11,I don't often disagree with Mark Kermode but I found this a big disappointment.
4.5,2022.06.10,One of my favorite non-English films with witty writing and amazing performances. Story is great as well.
5,2022.05.31,simplesmente o melhor filme do ano dele.
5,2022.05.30,My favorite movie out there for sure. It has great pacing with an exciting genre combination and always keeps the audience on its toes with great symbolism and relevant themes.
4.5,2022.05.26,"Amazing portrayal of how human evilness manifests differently between social classes - while still featuring a riveting plot. Blends humor, suspense, and dark moments super well and transfers well to an American audience. Definitely deserved Best Picture."
5,2022.05.12,One of the best movies ever created
5,2022.05.06,"Outstanding Cinema. This is a much watch. It has all the ingredients of a classic film — humor, sadness, excitement, despair and hope. I'm not sure exactly who is the parasite though since the story does a great job of not turning any of its characters into a villain. Does a great job of displaying the contrast between abject poverty and extreme wealth and how classism plays out and ends in tragedy."
5,2022.05.06,A brilliant film! Truly a masterpiece.
5,2022.05.04,"When I finished Parasite, I called my best friend. ""Have you seen this movie??"" I asked, to which he replied, ""No"". ""You NEED to see this movie"" I urged. There isn't much more to say. If you still haven't seen Parasite, you NEED to see it."
5,2022.05.01,"Amazing thriller, it will make you think what would happen next throughout the entire film and will still make you wonder what might have happened next even after film ends."
4.5,2022.05.01,"Full of surprises, humor, and social commentary, it ultimately ends with deep pathos. Nothing is what it seems, and it ends up being even more so. It seems fairly light and what will turn out to be more a caper than what it becomes, which is a hammer over the head. A very impressive film that will keep you thinking long after it's over. Deeply affecting."
5,2022.04.26,Best movie in a long time.
5,2022.04.25,"through dark humor, the film describes the incredible misery it can mean to be human. the rich are deviant from reality and the others are excluded from reality. the end shows that the hope of being human just like everyone else never disappears."
5,2022.04.23,"I loved this movie, it is one of my favorites. It is a movie with many metaphors, clear examples of social stratification, very interesting plots that will leave you amazed, very good cinematography and direction. A movie that has tributes and deserves them, if you are not a big fan of Asian cinema, I recommend this movie and I hope you like it :)"
5,2022.04.22,Absolutely phenomenal! I don’t usually like Best Picture winners or foreign movies (because of reading subtitles)…this movie is one of the best I’ve ever seen! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
5,2022.04.21,"So f*cking good, must watch!"
5,2022.04.07,"Parasite is a visually and emotionally stunning experience like no other film and undeniably meets all the criteria in order to be called a masterpiece. Having won many awards at the 92nd Academy Awards like Best International Feature Film, this movie is an absolute gem because of its acting, cinematography, and its relatability. Based in Korea the greatest deceitful scheme yet of the Kim family begins to unravel in many unexpecting ways that leave the audience stunned. Parasite offers a wide range of talented actors that advanced the story overall, creating such believable families. The cinematography is award-winning that helps support the main theme through the use of its unbelievable camera angles and lighting. Its ability to relate to the audience is what truly grants this film a must-watch alongside its technical aspects. It's an insightful look into the universal idea of inequality among different classes of people that generally affects everyone globally. All these fundamental elements artfully woven together give the impression of an entirely new movie experience, which makes it stand above the rest."
0.5,2022.04.04,"This is one of the worst moves I have ever seen. It's boring, and the premise is ridiculous. I read a whole bunch of reviews to try to find out what I was missing. The reviews made no sense. This is an example of a movie people think they're supposed to like so they do."
3,2022.03.31,Nothing attractive about anyone in this movie
0.5,2022.03.30,"NUNCA UM FILME COM TANTO DEFEITO, UMA MERDA, UM MONTE DE XING LING JUNTO N TEM COMO FICAR BOM, SEM AÇAO, SEM LUTA E SANGUE, FICAR TRES HORAS OUVINDO CHANFRRFFMVOEM, SIMPLEMENTE O PIOR FILME Q EU JA VI."
5,2022.03.22,"Not only that Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite delivered in terms of telling a very well crafted story and theme, it also delivers compelling characters that were well performed by its cast."
5,2022.03.13,One of the greatest movies of all time. Beautiful all the way through
5,2022.03.13,"Eu ainda preciso encontrar as palavras pra redigir melhor, porém, esse é o meu estilo de filmes Thriller."
0.5,2022.03.12,"Oh terrific! Thank you so much for making me depressed! That's just what I wanted in a movie. I'm sure I was the last person on Earth to watch this movie, but if there's another out there reading this: skip this terribly sad movie and be thankful you never had to realize how terrible our planet is."
5,2022.03.12,This movie is brilliant. I don't even know what to say.
1,2022.03.12,"Absolute bs, don't know what all the fuss is about."
2.5,2022.03.07,"Very much hyped up in my opinion, few thrilling moments but it was hard to understand some of the character choices"
4,2022.03.06,"Piękny, niepokojący, bardzo wciągający, treściwy, smutny. Zakończenie w połowie super, w połowie całkiem z dupy"
3.5,2022.02.27,"Entertaining *dark* scatterbrain comedy, that goes off waaay into the weeds at the 3/4 mark. Works, makes sense - you root for the Kim's - until the bizarre events of toward the end. Those choices seem somewhat contrived, and out of character for characters that have repeatedly demonstrated themselves as bright, and capable of 'passing for hardworking smarter-than-everyone-else competent people', for extended periods of time to get and keep their target jobs. Truthfully though, this dichotomy does create a substantial mismatch with the early depiction of them as substantially lazy, intoxicated underachievers, that can't consistently even fold boxes with any consistency, who suddenly and miraculously pull 'smart choices', and super-spy-level skills and talents out of seeming 'nowhere'. I think it misses somewhat in the 'capitalism is the problem' angle, widely pitched, as the Kims are clearly very capable and motivated, and can achieve amazing things, when they apply themselves, but seem to have arrived at their semi-basement apartment - and their lifestyle of sitting around folding pizza boxes - through utter lack of motivation and rampant inertia. Recommended, just not as satisfying as I'd hoped."
5,2022.02.25,"Its triumph at the Oscars didn't surprise me that much: this movie is simply amazing! You have to watch it at different times in order to get all its cryptic messages. Plot, storytelling, screenplay, shots, and dialogues need to be deeply studied. A flawless masterpiece from South Korea! Highly recommended! My rating: 10/10"
5,2022.02.24,"Superbly developed storytelling with real edge of the seat tension and unexpected plot turns. It's a long film, but the time flies by as you are drawn in to this masterpiece. Don't miss it!"
5,2022.02.23,Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch Must watch!
5,2022.02.23,"It's no wonder this film won Best Film of the Year. It is quite honestly one of the most perfect movies I've ever seen. Three very defined acts with three very different purposes. The third act is easily the most entrancing 30-45 minutes of a film I've ever seen. Things begin to change, and they change quickly. I'm not trying to say too much because I don't want to spoil ANYTHING Parasite has the greatest ending I've ever seen in a film. And that's genuine. Seriously, no words. This review has taken so long to write and this is all I got. MUST. SEE. FILM."
4.5,2022.02.17,Disturbing but brilliant
2.5,2022.02.15,"It was shot well, but it didn't have a good story or ending. I wouldn't want to watch it again. It also could have been a lot shorter."
4,2022.02.13,Very good! Even if you don't care for whatever message about inequality the movie may or may not have.
2.5,2022.02.07,"Entertaining and touches on some interesting themes, but the tone shifts wildly throughout the movie and elements of the plot make no sense."
4.5,2022.02.01,"This is a very accomplished, unique piece of cinema. I did not expect to like it as much as I did."
3.5,2022.01.30,"I didn't like this movie that much, but the ending is totally brilliant"
3.5,2022.01.29,"I loved the first half! it really captured me and wow is the photography brilliant. However I didn't like the second half as much, it got a bit too dark and it made me feel bad."
5,2022.01.28,La mejor película que he visto en mi vida!! Todo es excelente!!
0.5,2022.01.27,"Absolutely apallingly bad. One of only three movies I was unable to watch to the end, I was so boredIi had to walk away and had to pick up where I left off several days later. It's hard to decide upon which area lets this movie down the most, directing, acting, writing or cinematography, they all vie for the title. Low brow, hackneyed and predictable, this was just awful."
5,2022.01.27,Best movie of all time
5,2022.01.25,"Thrill knows no language. My stomach was in a knot the entire film from start to finish, from the dark comedic beginning to its masterful pivot into horror and suspense at the midpoint. Parasite is a masterpiece and well-deserving of its status as Best Picture."
5,2022.01.21,"As brilliant a film on my fifth viewing as it was on my first. Unforgettable, unique and well deserving of the praise and awards it has received since it premiered at Cannes over 2 years ago. Don't let subtitles influence your decision to skip this film: you will regret it."
4.5,2022.01.18,This Movie was Wild. I am usually not a fan of subtitles but this movie was fantastic. if you are up for a mind game that is somehow relatable and realistic. with a Tarantino twist and ode with a gruesome ending to the movie- simply leaves you with your jaw dropped. Wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. with the right kind of suspense and curiosity this movie was solid! would recommend.
4,2022.01.17,"Parasite deserves its awards. It's unique, refreshing and innovative. It is well-paced and well-acted. It would make you laugh with its witty plot and dialogues. At the same time, it will shock you with some grueling scenes. A brilliantly executed con movie. It's the first foreign-language movie to win Best Picture at the Oscars, so it's bound to inspire and encourage more film makers around the world."
5,2022.01.15,"a solid film with amazing cinematography! The actors were beyond exceptional and the story's plot moves from comedy to thriller, and underneath all the excitement, the film highlights important messages about society, class, and the human experience. For more check out my WordPress blog! https://wordpress.com/posts/expressourworld.wordpress.com"
2,2022.01.14,"Disturbing. That's the first word that comes to mind. I appreciate disturbing movies when they teach me something or make me reflect but honestly I don't get why so much fuss about this one. I see the point about it highlighting the inequalities between rich and poor people and the fact that poor people would go to some length to improve their status but I didn't find that there was anything deeper than that. Perhaps some of the images slightly symbolical, ie. poor people living in the basement below the rich and the family's dad killing a bug (ie. 'parasite') at the start, but that's the easiest kind of symbols one can come up with. I totally don't get the fuss. What am I missing?"
5,2022.01.10,"Bong Joon-ho keeps stepping up his game with every movie he directs: The Host (2006), Snowpiercer (2013), Okja (2017). And now the Palme d'Or winning movie: Parasite (2019). This movie contains wonderful pacing. It is a slow cooker with an explosive face-off in the final act. The humor scattered throughout the story is a perfect way to ease the tension before the characters cannot stand it anymore."
4,2022.01.02,Oscar-winning Korean thriller which subtly but sharply critiques the societal class divide between rich and poor. Worthy Oscar winner that is thrilling and funny at the same time without losing face.
5,2022.01.02,It's really that good.
4,2022.01.02,"Fan f***ing tastic. It was very slow and I found myself wanting it to end, but the final 20 minutes paid off superbly. I definitely think it's worth the Oscar; it delivers a powerful message in an original way. Point docked for American Indigenous stereotyping :/"
5,2021.12.21,An absolute original in every sense of the word!
5,2021.12.11,"Summary: Ki-woo's parents are unemployed and trying to make ends meet. After his friend refers him to an affluent family seeking a tutor, Ki-woo tells a white lie about his qualifications and lands the job. Pretty soon, his family members are conveniently landing jobs as well! Takeaways: A unique thriller that left my heart racing, but for different reasons than most films. Fascinating characters + white lies = eerie fates. P.S. Don't let the Korean language dissuade you. Reading the subtitles doesn't take away the suspense or strangeness of the film."
3.5,2021.12.09,Strange little movie but enjoyable. Well acted .
5,2021.12.04,"It takes the orignal plot and turns it on it's head, and I loved the way it worked giving a great message and keeping us engaged."
5,2021.12.03,"amazingly metaphorical, top tier cinematography, top tier acting, literally life changing, probably one of the best movies of all time"
5,2021.12.02,The best Korean movie.
5,2021.11.30,"South Korea has an answer for M. Night Shyamalan. That answer is Bong Joon-ho. Bong Joon-ho and his masterpiece Parasite has so much nuance moments in the film especially with the tone shifts. What I loved the most about the tone shift in this film was when the doorbell rang, the main characters get into deeper trouble then they thought with a hint of a twist. The music is beautiful, the writing is brilliant, and the intense scenes during the climax are just miraculous. Parasite is such an extraordinary that will be talked about for years to come."
2,2021.11.27,Didn't really udnerstand the ending or why the father did what he did. Odd movie.
5,2021.11.25,"Too little can be added to talk about this film, so I'll just reaffirm what we've heard millions of times: ""Parasite"" is a masterpiece wih no comparison."
3.5,2021.11.21,"Warning: SPOILERS It's possible that I watched this movie with my expectations too high. The way most critics wrote about this movie I was literally expecting something mind blowing. Well… it was…good. The first hour or so was really barely okay. This involved the poor family infiltrating the rich family by taking over the servants' jobs. Honestly, I normally wouldn't have made it through that first hour, but surely SOMETHING mind blowing was coming right? Well, not really. The rest of the movie was quite gripping at times. I really felt for the father of the poor family when he murdered the father of the rich family. That was Avery powerful scene. So add up a barely mediocre first half with a really good, but not great second half, and.., I don't get it? Is there something I'm missing here?"
5,2021.11.13,"Brilliant, amazing premise and execution, incredible immersive direction, cinematography, and editing. One of my favourite movies for this decade."
5,2021.11.08,10/10 If there was ever gonna be a perfect movie this is definitely in that conversation.
4.5,2021.11.07,"The movie offered an insight to the class divide that exists throughout society within South Korea, although it could be applied to the U.S as well. The conflict between the rich and the poor culminate into a dramatic climax that leaves one wondering how two different worlds can coexist."
3.5,2021.11.05,Pretty disturbing… and funny… kept me on the edge of my seat.
5,2021.10.26,"Pure genius in story, directing, and pacing. Shifts between tones seamlessly and completely captivates the viewer during and after its runtime. It’s message is poignantly told, and let’s the viewer interpret its meaning without slapping you over the head with it. A masterpiece."
5,2021.10.25,Hands down the best movie of the year. I wish I could see it for the first time every month.
3.5,2021.10.24,"While it was good, I didn't find it incredible enough to win the Academy Award. The last half hour or so was uninteresting and a drag."
5,2021.10.16,"Excelente película, una cinta totalmente merecedora ganadora de todos los premios que recibió. No estaba seguro de qué esperar, pero la trama, los giros, la reflexión ante los temas de interacción entre clases sociales, la fotografía, su mensaje final, la dirección, las actuaciones; todo es excelente. También tiene algunos toques de humor muy bien implementados. En conjunto toda la película es muy entretenida por lo que es muy fácil de ver y no te vas a aburrir para nada. Me gusta que es original y mezcla varios géneros diferentes. No entra en ningún molde, si bien hace guiños a películas clásicas, me parece muy original. En conclusión, una excelente película que creo yo todos deberían ver porque es genial y su final te termina impactando. Muy recomendada."
1.5,2021.10.15,"The movie itself is terrible. The story is terrible and doesn't make sense. But the main thing is it's not a movie, it's an artistic piece detailing the separation between the rich and the poor."
5,2021.10.13,THIS MOVIE IS A MASTERPIECE !!!!!
5,2021.10.09,Beautifully layered story about the horrors of our de facto class system.
3.5,2021.10.06,"Good movie. Love to see that Korean movies are becoming mainstream. Little boring sometimes, but overall is pretty good."
5,2021.10.06,Masterpiece. A must-watch for any film connoisseur.
5,2021.10.04,"Revisiting this movie after Squid Game. While the two have no relation, I can't help but pair them together. They both reflect the harsh reality of social hierarchy, loan sharks, financial instability, and the filthy rich. Combinations which, as we see in both Parasite and Squid Game, lead to utter chaos."
5,2021.09.30,A masterpiece of original filmmaking.
5,2021.09.24,"Best movie of 2019 and the best Non-English movie ever made. Even though it can be hard to focus on the subtitles and the movie at the same time, it never fails to serve one of the best cinematic experiences ever."
5,2021.09.24,"A very accurate depiction of the wealth gap that is relatable anywhere you go in the world. It shows how desperate people become for money and the small, subtle messages throughout the film make the movie even more exciting to watch."
5,2021.09.19,a really good movie and bcuz of it i start watching some korean movies
4,2021.09.19,"Fantastic. Definitely a different feel from most movies I've seen. Worth the watch and the insight into the social commentary. I had a very different perception of this movie when I saw its poster. It definitely turns dark very quickly at the end, but then has a nice yet eerie resolution in the end. Would recommend if you enjoy film and something different."
5,2021.09.18,"Parasite movie is outstanding. It has many levels, great detail and a fresh, even harsh look at the rich-poor divide in the world today. Some scenes evoke Tarantino's signature, but it is made in the best tradition of Japanese movie art. You cannot stop to think about this film even next day. Every body must see it and think about our wrong world where one part lives in prosperity and the other part struggles restlessly to survive."
3,2021.09.15,"Since it received the 2020 Best Picture Academy award, I felt compelled to watch the film despite the fact that it was sub-titled with no English overdub or Audio Description. Too bad I hadn't taken more than a couple of semesters of French in high school, since they did have a French overdub track. ;-) It was a decent film. I'm not sure it was worthy of best picture, though."
4.5,2021.09.15,Hold on to your seats lots of twists and turns
5,2021.09.13,"A surprising like for me. Though, not sure why, since I watch subtitled shows all the time in Japanese. I really enjoyed the peek into Korean culture, or at least what I assume to be Korean culture. It's fresh and different. It blends seriousness and comedy very well, and it's definitely up there for movies I've seen. I'm not entirely sure about the message itself. I rarely find that movies can deliver a stellar message, like a book can, as they don't seem to have enough time. But it's very entertaining and worth re-watching, which I wouldn't say about too many movies."
3.5,2021.09.10,"Enjoyable yet anxiety ridden. A good watch, but doesn't quite warrant all the praise it gets. Good acting and a somewhat interesting plot."
4.5,2021.09.03,One of the best Korean movies I've watched. The soundtrack itself was amazing. 9/10
5,2021.09.02,"This movie is wild. Thrilling, funny, suspending, etc. great movie. Very unpredictable as well, which I liked, made me more engaged"
5,2021.08.30,One of my favorite movies!
5,2021.08.29,"What a rollercoaster. The first thing that stood out was the cinematography and environments in this film which are gorgeous. The structure of the story is subtle and peels away layers as its interesting characters become more involved in the plot. The music elegantly heightens the tone of this film too. The film is multilayered and universal in its themes but may lose some nuisance in the narrative screenplay due to its translation and being ingrained in Korean culture. People leeching off of others is apparent. The social commentary here is blatant. Karma is a thing. But what I felt resonated most was the importance of family. The theme continuously appears throughout this film without you even realising but is ultimately driven home in the final scenes. Bong Joon Ho has constructed a modern film that hits the current zeitgeist of today, but in a way that will not become dated. Parasite is a weave of dark tones, intrigue, mystery, and humour, and is the pinnacle of modern international cinema today."
5,2021.08.24,"I truly love this film. Its' dark, witty class satire is unlike anything I've seen in a long while."
5,2021.08.23,Enjoyed this more then I expected.
5,2021.08.22,"Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's best work. With incredible Acting, Cinematography, Writing, Lighting and more that's just sandwiched brilliantly together! It's one of my favorite films right next to Evil Dead II."
5,2021.08.15,This movie kept me on the edge of the seat and I want to watch it again very soon. Crazy good.
5,2021.08.14,"In the era of the complete domination of the superhero movies, Parasite is a symbol of sagacity with its allegorical story telling. Maybe a wake up call for Hollywood that CGI is not the one-way road to success."
4,2021.08.14,"Interesting and entertaining, but not nearly as deep as people think."
5,2021.08.09,"Only one word can define this movie: Spectacular.. I believe that giving academy award to it is one of the wisest decisions the academy has made... The story, its structure, the analogies and metaphors at the background, acting, the ending... Everything was great.. Strongly recommended.. Must watch.."
5,2021.08.02,"A perfect example of ""I think I know what this is, oh wait, oh no"", the movie is surprising, enjoyable, and thrilling, and it's interesting how every little thing plays in the story. A really nice movie!"
4,2021.07.31,"This Korean movie is a great one with lots of fun and trouble. The poor family help out in a rich families home, and make a lot of money. They discover secrets about the house that not even the rich people know of. Will they tell anyone or will they loose everything if discovered."
3.5,2021.07.29,‘The true measure of any society can be found in how it treats its most vulnerable members' A black comedy on social inequality! Something different!
5,2021.07.27,"i like realism film very much , most of south kroea movie are good at it, and i think parasite is the best one. it shocked me a lot the first time i watched it"
5,2021.07.26,One of the best movies of 2019
4.5,2021.07.25,"No turn that Bong Joon-ho's Parasite takes is expected, this is a thrilling, insane film that's never ever boring."
5,2021.07.25,The first-ever movie I watched that was in another language. The cinematography and filming was incredible. And the ending was really good. Highly Recommend. I really hope there is a parasite 2.
5,2021.07.23,"Work of art, such a good movie, a raw look into reality and the ""fight"" of social classes, I don't thing we´ll see sth as good as this one in a few years."
3.5,2021.07.20,"Good, but not great."
5,2021.07.20,BAM SMACK POW MIND BLOWN
5,2021.07.19,"Another rewatch, and this time it's another Bong Joon-Ho incredible work. The first half was funny and entertaining due to the witty ways that the main family climbed their ways into making a living. This wouldn't work well without the brilliant acting from the cast as well as the clever script. The second half was where the themes became apparently clear. The intestines scenes showed the struggles and determinations that the lower class had in order to climb up the society. Through the conversations, we had a maddening look at the differences between the two social classes, and how fed up one can feel. The use of symbolism was brilliant and subtle, which made the script even more masterful. Overall, arguably Bong Joon-Ho's best work. 9.5/10"
5,2021.07.12,"'Parasite' is an incredible, thrilling, suspenseful, twisty, sophisticated film. Not one moment on screen is wasted when this exciting plot is unfolding. It is very difficult to praise this film without revealing any spoilers, but if you are even curious about watching this, watch it. The discussion about the classism around the world is incredibly realized. Every actor does a wonderful job and the production value is really strong which just adds to the value of the film itself."
4,2021.07.10,A movie that digs deep into human psychology.
5,2021.07.08,"This movie is truly a masterpiece. The storytelling and plot are just so well thought out and complex, and the acting is outstanding. Parasite is honestly one of the best movies I have ever watched."
5,2021.07.07,great movie! A great cast with a great plot cant ask much better than that for a movie!
5,2021.07.06,"Wow, this family is so poor that they don't even live on ground level, they live below the street, below society. I like the mother, she's sassy and doesn't give a damn to speak her mind. Wow, that place is like a fortress. It's so beautiful, pristine like a palace. It looks like it doesn't even belong in the city. Something's kind of fishy with this huge house and it's inhabitants and I'm very curios as to what happens. I've noticed from watching several Korean movies, that they have a really good sense of humor. Almost very random and unexpected when it happens. The madame is quite attractive, she's cute. She's also very lively and has a great sense of humor. Hmm, that wall illuminating all the dishes and kitchen ware seems important, very interesting. These poor kids are really street smart, what they lack in wealth, they may up for with wits and grit. Fake it till you make it I guess is their motto. Wow, I don't know what to think about this poor family. Their motives and their plan is quite diabolical. They've basically gotten rid of all the help the rich family had. They even got rid of the housekeeper who seemed like a nice older lady. They seem kind of scum baggy to me, they're scummy people. I'm beginning to think that this poor family isn't a family at all and maybe they like work for the same company or person or something? Dude wtf is going on? Lol! There's this underground room where the old housekeeper's husband is living down there? Dude this is so fucking weird. I can't believe they got away with that escape. Holy shit, that was butt clenching. It's at this moment that the movie shifts into a completely different direction and even changes in mood and genre becoming more of a thriller/horror. It seems like the main theme is this movie is lies and deception. What you see, isn't really what you get and you can't really trust just about anyone, even if they're recommended by a reliable source. It's very odd to watch unfold, but this poor family has basically integrated themselves into the lives of this rich family. I guess they're all parasites feeding off this rich family. I don't know why but now I feel like the rich family is going to do something unexpected. I feel like there's going to be some kind of fucked up twist that's going to happen. They were the stink bugs all along, the lower class, the poor. There was a lot of twisted moments from both families. Beautifully filmed. The cinematography and compositions are impeccable. A feat of technical perfection. Brilliantly and cleverly written. Masterfully executed and filled with plenty of beautiful symbolism and metaphors. My only problem with the movie is that it's hard to relate to any of the characters since they're all essentially parasites and they all have really scummy characteristics to them, both the poor and the rich families. I guess I could relate the most to the rich families son and daughter. Watching this movie movie was something very exciting and thrilling, I didn't know what to expect next. I would definitely watch this movie again."
3.5,2021.07.04,A very good film. Is it the sixth best film ever made in the history of time? No. It is not the sixth best film ever made in the history of time. Can we calm down please? This is a good film. Let's leave it at that.
5,2021.07.03,"Audiovisualmente hermosa, actuaciones espectaculares y una trama que te mantiene expectante, sin duda parasite es una obra maestra que logra transmitir el suspenso y la angustia al espectador; y dar un claro mensaje sobre el panorama de la desigualdad económica en la sociedad."
5,2021.06.28,The perfect combination of the genius mind of Bong Joon Ho with an all-around stellar cast creates arguably one of the greatest films ever made.
5,2021.06.25,"A MASTERPIECE! Oh my, this film is unlike any other I've ever watched. Parasite truly proves that Koreans are capable of competing in anything. It's no surprise that this film has received countless honors and nominations, particularly at the Oscars, because it deserves them all. And the finale tho. It's a little bloody and disturbing, but it's also extremely satisfying. It's like watching Once Upon a Time in Hollywood all over again, but much better. I don't think I need to go into detail because it's flawless in every way. A film that is both distinctive and realistically remarkable. Go ahead and watch it on your own!"
5,2021.06.24,An absolute masterpiece. A truly thrilling film that keeps you on edge.
4.5,2021.06.22,"A dramatic and thrilling piece of film, a commentary on how lower class and upper class citizens are viewed and treated. The ending felt rather…far fetched, but it definitely didn't take away from the meaning of the film. I loved this, definitely deserving of a watch and 2019's film of the year."
4.5,2021.06.19,It's no wonder that this movie won an Oscar. It's nice seeing a fresh story. The acting was really good. I liked seeing how Koreans live and how they're culturally different from us.
0.5,2021.06.19,One of the most overestimated films in history.
4.5,2021.06.15,"great, cool storyline, interesting and really good acting"
4.5,2021.06.13,"Great film, definitely deserved best picture"
5,2021.06.11,) It was just a masterpiece.The director is a legendary writer too.
5,2021.06.11,"What a masterpiece. A movie that makes you forget you're watching a movie. Even without the twist, it was still a brilliant film."
5,2021.06.05,"Simply just a masterpiece. Amazing story, excellent performances, beautiful cinematography. Please don’t let the language barrier prevent you from seeing this. One of the best films I’ve ever seen."
