4.5,2026.01.14,"I clearly remember the feeling when Parasite ended: the sense of having seen something different, uncomfortable and, at the same time, strangely entertaining. It’s not just that the film is original — which it is — but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing. It starts almost like a game, makes you lower your guard… and before you realize it, you’re already deep into something much **** of the great strengths of Korean cinema, and something that’s especially evident here, is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission. Black comedy, social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here, slowly creeping in. Nothing feels forced. Everything flows with a deceptive naturalness, as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you **** staging is key. The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."

Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."

4.5,2025.10.04,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
4,2025.08.27,"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
4,2025.08.19,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic—often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
4.5,2025.06.17,"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
5,2025.05.13,"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,2025.05.04,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."
0,2024.12.29,Eu não sei como uma porcaria dessas consegue receber 4 oscars. Filme não serve nem para passar em uma sessão da **** de tão ruim.
5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
3.5,2024.06.17,"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."
5,2024.06.16,"Энэ бол зөвхөн Бонгийн л бүтээж чадах кино юм: догшин ширүүн, сүүлийн үеийн капитализмын утгагүй зүйлсийг хатуу шүүмжилсэн хэрнээ хөгжилтэй, хэзээ ч цочирдомгүй.  Энэ бол оны шилдэг кинонуудын нэг юм."
5,2024.04.22,"Parasita é um clássico instantâneo, o melhor filme do século 21 e um dos melhores de todos os tempos!"
5,2023.12.27,"Masterpiece. A gift for Humanity. 
Do you want to see what's inequality about ?
Take a look. Enjoy."
5,2023.11.17,It starts off slow. Almost decided to watch something else. I read other people’s reviews and had some patience. It just gets crazier and crazier in a good way. Solid film.
3.5,2023.11.03,"A very stylish film with lots of funny moments, but I have to admit that I felt a little underwhelmed after all the hype. That's on me, not the film. This was very good, but no more."
5,2023.07.27,"If Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer) hasn't already solidified himself as one of the greatest living directors, then Parasite removes any last doubt. This masterfully crafted story about class discrepancy is a must-see. Just make every attempt to avoid spoilers before going in."
5,2023.07.24,"A brilliant and thought-provoking movie that explores the themes of class, inequality, and social mobility. It’s a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world we live in. The film is a must-see for anyone interested in the art of cinema."
4.5,2023.06.27,"Excellent movie. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning"
5,2023.05.13,"Masterpiece. The film is at times funny, poignant, original, thrilling. A social satire that also hits home."
0,2023.04.29,Like **** ****ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
5,2022.11.25,It starts out like a fun comedy. Then the movie just does a **** 360 and it turns into a thriller.
5,2022.11.22,A brilliant film that is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. So glad that it won Best Picture.
5,2022.09.06,This masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. I had watched it more than three times and I'm thinking of rewatching it at 4k BluRay.
2,2022.07.03,"Not nearly as good as the Rating says it is.  Its about a family of crappy, dirty, slobs that are squatters.  Literally thats it.  Oh they accidently kill people or something.  Lame."
5,2022.06.28,"Mindblowing. This movie catches your attention from the beggining to the very end, and the performance of the actors is brilliant. Definitely a must-see."
5,2022.05.17,"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."
5,2022.05.10,"A masterpiece of modern cinema. Sequences are so well put together. Extremely intense film. A critique on the social structure of todays society. Characters, plot and cinematography are all outstanding. One of my favourite films ever."
5,2022.05.02,"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
5,2022.05.02,God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
5,2022.04.30,"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."

5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
3.5,2024.06.17,"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."

5,2022.05.17,"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."

5,2022.05.02,"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
5,2022.05.02,God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
5,2022.04.30,"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."
4.5,2026.01.14,"I clearly remember the feeling when Parasite ended: the sense of having seen something different, uncomfortable and, at the same time, strangely entertaining. It’s not just that the film is original — which it is — but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing. It starts almost like a game, makes you lower your guard… and before you realize it, you’re already deep into something much **** of the great strengths of Korean cinema, and something that’s especially evident here, is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission. Black comedy, social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here, slowly creeping in. Nothing feels forced. Everything flows with a deceptive naturalness, as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you **** staging is key. The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."
5,2025.12.02,"Greetings from Lithuania.
Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."
4,2025.10.16,"I love everything about this movie. It actually depicted life with Poor people and their mindset with the rich People. Beautiful movie. I love it



John CHIZOBAVINCENT"
4.5,2025.10.04,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
4,2025.08.27,"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
4,2025.08.19,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic—often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
4.5,2025.06.17,"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
5,2025.05.13,"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,2025.05.04,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future.

Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
4,2025.08.27,"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
4,2025.08.19,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic—often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
4.5,2025.06.17,"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
5,2025.05.13,"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,2025.05.04,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."
0,2024.12.29,Eu não sei como uma porcaria dessas consegue receber 4 oscars. Filme não serve nem para passar em uma sessão da **** de tão ruim.
5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
3.5,2024.06.17,"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."
5,2024.06.16,"Энэ бол зөвхөн Бонгийн л бүтээж чадах кино юм: догшин ширүүн, сүүлийн үеийн капитализмын утгагүй зүйлсийг хатуу шүүмжилсэн хэрнээ хөгжилтэй, хэзээ ч цочирдомгүй.  Энэ бол оны шилдэг кинонуудын нэг юм."
5,2024.04.22,"Parasita é um clássico instantâneo, o melhor filme do século 21 e um dos melhores de todos os tempos!"
5,2023.12.27,"Masterpiece. A gift for Humanity. 
Do you want to see what's inequality about ?
Take a look. Enjoy."
5,2023.11.17,It starts off slow. Almost decided to watch something else. I read other people’s reviews and had some patience. It just gets crazier and crazier in a good way. Solid film.
3.5,2023.11.03,"A very stylish film with lots of funny moments, but I have to admit that I felt a little underwhelmed after all the hype. That's on me, not the film. This was very good, but no more."
5,2023.07.27,"If Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer) hasn't already solidified himself as one of the greatest living directors, then Parasite removes any last doubt. This masterfully crafted story about class discrepancy is a must-see. Just make every attempt to avoid spoilers before going in."
5,2023.07.24,"A brilliant and thought-provoking movie that explores the themes of class, inequality, and social mobility. It’s a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world we live in. The film is a must-see for anyone interested in the art of cinema."
4.5,2023.06.27,"Excellent movie. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning"
5,2023.05.13,"Masterpiece. The film is at times funny, poignant, original, thrilling. A social satire that also hits home."
0,2023.04.29,Like **** ****ttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
5,2022.11.25,It starts out like a fun comedy. Then the movie just does a **** 360 and it turns into a thriller.
5,2022.11.22,A brilliant film that is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. So glad that it won Best Picture.
5,2022.09.06,This masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. I had watched it more than three times and I'm thinking of rewatching it at 4k BluRay.
2,2022.07.03,"Not nearly as good as the Rating says it is.  Its about a family of crappy, dirty, slobs that are squatters.  Literally thats it.  Oh they accidently kill people or something.  Lame."
5,2022.06.28,"Mindblowing. This movie catches your attention from the beggining to the very end, and the performance of the actors is brilliant. Definitely a must-see."
5,2022.05.17,"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."
5,2022.05.10,"A masterpiece of modern cinema. Sequences are so well put together. Extremely intense film. A critique on the social structure of todays society. Characters, plot and cinematography are all outstanding. One of my favourite films ever."
5,2022.05.02,"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
5,2022.05.02,God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
5,2022.04.30,"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."
4.5,2026.01.14,"I clearly remember the feeling when Parasite ended: the sense of having seen something different, uncomfortable and, at the same time, strangely entertaining. It’s not just that the film is original — which it is — but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing. It starts almost like a game, makes you lower your guard… and before you realize it, you’re already deep into something much **** of the great strengths of Korean cinema, and something that’s especially evident here, is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission. Black comedy, social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here, slowly creeping in. Nothing feels forced. Everything flows with a deceptive naturalness, as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you **** staging is key. The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."
5,2025.12.02,"Greetings from Lithuania.
Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."

After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."

Do you want to see what's inequality about ?
Take a look. Enjoy."
5,2023.11.17,It starts off slow. Almost decided to watch something else. I read other people’s reviews and had some patience. It just gets crazier and crazier in a good way. Solid film.

5,2022.11.25,It starts out like a fun comedy. Then the movie just does a **** 360 and it turns into a thriller.
5,2022.11.22,A brilliant film that is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. So glad that it won Best Picture.
5,2022.09.06,This masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. I had watched it more than three times and I'm thinking of rewatching it at 4k BluRay.

5,2022.06.28,"Mindblowing. This movie catches your attention from the beggining to the very end, and the performance of the actors is brilliant. Definitely a must-see."
5,2022.05.17,"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."
5,2022.05.10,"A masterpiece of modern cinema. Sequences are so well put together. Extremely intense film. A critique on the social structure of todays society. Characters, plot and cinematography are all outstanding. One of my favourite films ever."
5,2022.05.02,"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
5,2022.05.02,God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
5,2022.04.30,"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."
4.5,2026.01.14,"I clearly remember the feeling when Parasite ended: the sense of having seen something different, uncomfortable and, at the same time, strangely entertaining. It’s not just that the film is original — which it is — but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing. It starts almost like a game, makes you lower your guard… and before you realize it, you’re already deep into something much **** of the great strengths of Korean cinema, and something that’s especially evident here, is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission. Black comedy, social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here, slowly creeping in. Nothing feels forced. Everything flows with a deceptive naturalness, as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you **** staging is key. The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."
5,2025.12.02,"Greetings from Lithuania.
Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."
4,2025.10.16,"I love everything about this movie. It actually depicted life with Poor people and their mindset with the rich People. Beautiful movie. I love it



John CHIZOBAVINCENT"
4.5,2025.10.04,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
4,2025.08.27,"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
4,2025.08.19,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic—often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
4.5,2025.06.17,"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
5,2025.05.13,"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,2025.05.04,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."
0,2024.12.29,Eu não sei como uma porcaria dessas consegue receber 4 oscars. Filme não serve nem para passar em uma sessão da **** de tão ruim.
5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.

Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
4.5,2025.06.17,"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
5,2025.05.13,"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,2025.05.04,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."

5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
3.5,2024.06.17,"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."

Do you want to see what's inequality about ?
Take a look. Enjoy."
5,2023.11.17,It starts off slow. Almost decided to watch something else. I read other people’s reviews and had some patience. It just gets crazier and crazier in a good way. Solid film.

5,2023.07.27,"If Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer) hasn't already solidified himself as one of the greatest living directors, then Parasite removes any last doubt. This masterfully crafted story about class discrepancy is a must-see. Just make every attempt to avoid spoilers before going in."
5,2023.07.24,"A brilliant and thought-provoking movie that explores the themes of class, inequality, and social mobility. It’s a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world we live in. The film is a must-see for anyone interested in the art of cinema."

5,2022.11.22,A brilliant film that is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. So glad that it won Best Picture.
5,2022.09.06,This masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. I had watched it more than three times and I'm thinking of rewatching it at 4k BluRay.
2,2022.07.03,"Not nearly as good as the Rating says it is.  Its about a family of crappy, dirty, slobs that are squatters.  Literally thats it.  Oh they accidently kill people or something.  Lame."
5,2022.06.28,"Mindblowing. This movie catches your attention from the beggining to the very end, and the performance of the actors is brilliant. Definitely a must-see."
5,2022.05.17,"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."
5,2022.05.10,"A masterpiece of modern cinema. Sequences are so well put together. Extremely intense film. A critique on the social structure of todays society. Characters, plot and cinematography are all outstanding. One of my favourite films ever."
5,2022.05.02,"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
5,2022.05.02,God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
5,2022.04.30,"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."
4.5,2026.01.14,"I clearly remember the feeling when Parasite ended: the sense of having seen something different, uncomfortable and, at the same time, strangely entertaining. It’s not just that the film is original — which it is — but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing. It starts almost like a game, makes you lower your guard… and before you realize it, you’re already deep into something much **** of the great strengths of Korean cinema, and something that’s especially evident here, is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission. Black comedy, social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here, slowly creeping in. Nothing feels forced. Everything flows with a deceptive naturalness, as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you **** staging is key. The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."
5,2025.12.02,"Greetings from Lithuania.
Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."

4.5,2025.10.04,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch.

5,2022.09.06,This masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. I had watched it more than three times and I'm thinking of rewatching it at 4k BluRay.
2,2022.07.03,"Not nearly as good as the Rating says it is.  Its about a family of crappy, dirty, slobs that are squatters.  Literally thats it.  Oh they accidently kill people or something.  Lame."
5,2022.06.28,"Mindblowing. This movie catches your attention from the beggining to the very end, and the performance of the actors is brilliant. Definitely a must-see."
5,2022.05.17,"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."
5,2022.05.10,"A masterpiece of modern cinema. Sequences are so well put together. Extremely intense film. A critique on the social structure of todays society. Characters, plot and cinematography are all outstanding. One of my favourite films ever."
5,2022.05.02,"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
5,2022.05.02,God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
5,2022.04.30,"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."
4.5,2026.01.14,"I clearly remember the feeling when Parasite ended: the sense of having seen something different, uncomfortable and, at the same time, strangely entertaining. It’s not just that the film is original — which it is — but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing. It starts almost like a game, makes you lower your guard… and before you realize it, you’re already deep into something much **** of the great strengths of Korean cinema, and something that’s especially evident here, is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission. Black comedy, social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here, slowly creeping in. Nothing feels forced. Everything flows with a deceptive naturalness, as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you **** staging is key. The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."
5,2025.12.02,"Greetings from Lithuania.
Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."
4,2025.10.16,"I love everything about this movie. It actually depicted life with Poor people and their mindset with the rich People. Beautiful movie. I love it

4.5,2025.10.04,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
4,2025.08.27,"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
4,2025.08.19,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic—often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
4.5,2025.06.17,"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
5,2025.05.13,"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,2025.05.04,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."
0,2024.12.29,Eu não sei como uma porcaria dessas consegue receber 4 oscars. Filme não serve nem para passar em uma sessão da **** de tão ruim.
5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
3.5,2024.06.17,"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."
5,2024.06.16,"Энэ бол зөвхөн Бонгийн л бүтээж чадах кино юм: догшин ширүүн, сүүлийн үеийн капитализмын утгагүй зүйлсийг хатуу шүүмжилсэн хэрнээ хөгжилтэй, хэзээ ч цочирдомгүй.  Энэ бол оны шилдэг кинонуудын нэг юм."
5,2024.04.22,"Parasita é um clássico instantâneo, o melhor filme do século 21 e um dos melhores de todos os tempos!"
5,2023.12.27,"Masterpiece. A gift for Humanity. 
Do you want to see what's inequality about ?
Take a look. Enjoy."
5,2023.11.17,It starts off slow. Almost decided to watch something else. I read other people’s reviews and had some patience. It just gets crazier and crazier in a good way. Solid film.
3.5,2023.11.03,"A very stylish film with lots of funny moments, but I have to admit that I felt a little underwhelmed after all the hype. That's on me, not the film. This was very good, but no more."
5,2023.07.27,"If Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer) hasn't already solidified himself as one of the greatest living directors, then Parasite removes any last doubt. This masterfully crafted story about class discrepancy is a must-see. Just make every attempt to avoid spoilers before going in."
5,2023.07.24,"A brilliant and thought-provoking movie that explores the themes of class, inequality, and social mobility. It’s a movie that will make you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the world we live in. The film is a must-see for anyone interested in the art of cinema."
4.5,2023.06.27,"Excellent movie. The story is so enjoyable, scoring is really great, visual is decent, and the voice is stunning"

The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."

5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
3.5,2024.06.17,"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."

5,2023.07.27,"If Bong Joon-ho (The Host, Snowpiercer) hasn't already solidified himself as one of the greatest living directors, then Parasite removes any last doubt. This masterfully crafted story about class discrepancy is a must-see. Just make every attempt to avoid spoilers before going in."

5,2022.11.22,A brilliant film that is equal parts hilarious and disturbing. So glad that it won Best Picture.
5,2022.09.06,This masterpiece is one of the best films I have ever seen in my entire life. I had watched it more than three times and I'm thinking of rewatching it at 4k BluRay.
2,2022.07.03,"Not nearly as good as the Rating says it is.  Its about a family of crappy, dirty, slobs that are squatters.  Literally thats it.  Oh they accidently kill people or something.  Lame."
5,2022.06.28,"Mindblowing. This movie catches your attention from the beggining to the very end, and the performance of the actors is brilliant. Definitely a must-see."
5,2022.05.17,"This is my favorite movie of all time for several reasons. 1, I saw it in theaters with my dad, and he made all the appropriate grunts a father does when they enjoy something. His approval means everything to me. Now that I think of it, that's the only reason."
5,2022.05.10,"A masterpiece of modern cinema. Sequences are so well put together. Extremely intense film. A critique on the social structure of todays society. Characters, plot and cinematography are all outstanding. One of my favourite films ever."
5,2022.05.02,"Even though the plot isn't really something different, the way it's developed and the feeling the movie transmits is what makes the movie great, with's a rather simple plot even though crazy plot twists anyways transmit crazy feelings with plot twists such as the killing of the house owner the father for years living like an animal. And the vague glance of hope is shown at the end. It has important subjects like the class division, the people with higher socioeconomic status watching others as inferiors, and the insane obsession of the mentally filled with the houseowner his idealization."
5,2022.05.02,God bless Joon-Ho for his unique storytelling in which he finally deserved the awards for. You will not be disappointed by every twists & turns this film takes (thanks to his style!).
5,2022.04.30,"Absolute bonkers of a film. With the constantly evolving and mixing of many genres from comedy to horror, director Bong Joon-ho masterfully creates an exciting and thrilling take on class division with its excellent narrative, set designs, cinematography, and soundtracks, which all come together nicely to create a masterful visual story. Parasite (2019) is another great addition to Bong's filmography. Although, I do feel that it is one of his more accessible films, I could not stop thinking about this film every day."
4.5,2026.01.14,"I clearly remember the feeling when Parasite ended: the sense of having seen something different, uncomfortable and, at the same time, strangely entertaining. It’s not just that the film is original — which it is — but that it has that rare ability to constantly change its skin without the seams showing. It starts almost like a game, makes you lower your guard… and before you realize it, you’re already deep into something much **** of the great strengths of Korean cinema, and something that’s especially evident here, is its freedom to mix tones without asking for permission. Black comedy, social satire and a growing sense of tension all coexist here, slowly creeping in. Nothing feels forced. Everything flows with a deceptive naturalness, as if the film knows exactly when to make you laugh and when to make you **** staging is key. The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."
5,2025.12.02,"Greetings from Lithuania.
Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."

4.5,2025.10.04,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
4,2025.08.27,"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
4,2025.08.19,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic—often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."

The use of space, the contrasts between different worlds, and the way characters move within them say as much as the dialogue. There’s an almost surgical precision in every visual decision, but it never feels cold or calculated. On the contrary, everything serves a story that gains emotional weight without unnecessary **** the center of it all is Bong Joon-ho’s gaze, once again proving that he knows how to entertain without giving up on saying uncomfortable things. What’s interesting is that the film doesn’t openly judge. It observes, lets the viewer draw their own conclusions and, when it wants to, presses exactly where it hurts most. That mix of irony, cruelty and clarity is what makes it so ****’s not a film that ends when the credits roll. It lingers, making you rethink scenes, gestures and decisions. It has rhythm, bite and intelligence. And best of all, it never loses its sense of spectacle.I didn’t find it perfect, but very close to it. One of those films that justify, on their own, why cinema is still a place where unexpected things can happen."

Gisaengchung (2019) (""Parasite"") is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Gisaengchung"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market.Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year, right here along with ""Joker"" which i saw last week. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."

4.5,2025.10.04,"Une pépite coréenne. Un excellent moment passé pendant le visionnage. Un film à voir, absolument, que ce soit pour sa vision du problème des classes sociales. Le film est des fois assez visuel sans trop l'être, ce qui le rend assez accessible. Le film s'enchaine très bien et ne se précipite pas dans ce qu'il veut raconter."
4,2025.09.19,"Parasite is a masterful achievement that showcases Bong Joon-ho's exceptional directing prowess and storytelling brilliance. This film deserves every accolade it has received.

**Directing & Cinematography:**
Bong Joon-ho's direction is meticulous and purposeful. Every shot serves the narrative, particularly his use of vertical space to reinforce class divisions - from the Parks' elevated mansion to the Kims' semi-basement dwelling. The camera movements are deliberate, creating tension through simple pans and tilts. The rain sequence is cinematographically stunning, using weather as both plot device and visual metaphor. The production design seamlessly integrates with the cinematography to create distinct worlds that feel authentic yet symbolic.

**Script & Storytelling:**
The screenplay is a structural marvel that defies genre conventions while maintaining perfect narrative cohesion. What begins as a dark comedy gradually transforms into a thriller, then a horror film, without ever feeling disjointed. The script's genius lies in its ability to make us empathize with morally ambiguous characters while never excusing their actions. The dialogue feels natural and reveals character depth efficiently - each conversation serves multiple purposes, advancing plot while developing relationships and themes.

**Overall Impact:**
Parasite succeeds as both entertainment and social commentary. It explores class inequality with nuance, avoiding heavy-handed messaging while delivering powerful insights about economic disparity. The film's universal themes transcend cultural boundaries, making it accessible worldwide while remaining distinctly Korean. The pacing is expertly controlled, building tension methodically toward an explosive and inevitable conclusion.

This is cinema at its finest - technically brilliant, thematically rich, and emotionally resonant."
5,2025.08.29,Parasite is a remarkable film that really speaks to the nature of capitalism and the ever growing divide in class between the rich and the poor. The story of the movie sets it's footing and keeps climbing it's stairs all the way to the heights of the end beats. I am 100% certain this movie will be even better on a 2nd watch. GO WATCH THIS MOIVE RIGHT NOW!
4,2025.08.27,"A well-crafted mix of suspenseful drama and dark humour with a dose of social commentary thrown on top, this is one of the best foreign language films of recent times."
4,2025.08.19,"An Unforgettable Masterpiece... A Cinematic Rollercoaster That Gets Under Your SkinReview Body:It is a rare occasion when a film manages to be laugh-out-loud funny, nail-bitingly tense, and heart-wrenchingly tragic—often all at once. Bong Joon Ho's brilliant ""Parasite"" is not merely a film; it is a complete cinematic experience, a masterfully conducted symphony of conflicting emotions that dance together in perfect, unsettling **** story begins with a deceptively simple premise: a poor, crafty family hatches an ingenious plan to infiltrate the lives of a wealthy one. What starts as a sharp and wildly entertaining black comedy about a heist soon morphs, slowly and methodically, into something else entirely. Director Bong uses every tool in his cinematic arsenal—from the stunning cinematography that turns architecture into a main character, to the razor-sharp script where not a single word is wasted—to build a world where you feel everything is about to collapse at any **** ensemble cast performance is nothing short of magnificent; every actor delivers a flawless performance, adding layers of humanity and complexity to characters that could have easily been stereotypes.Without revealing any of its stunning surprises, ""Parasite"" is a film that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It is bold, incredibly entertaining, and profoundly thought-provoking. This is the kind of film that reminds us why we go to the movies in the first **** personal rating: 8.5/10 — An absolute must-see for any lover of true cinema."
5,2025.07.19,"Em Parasita, Bong Joon-ho salda a conta entre forma e conteúdo: o roteiro engenhoso costura humor negro e crítica social de forma indissociável. A família Kim, interpretada com camadas de ambição e vulnerabilidade, ecoa em cada cômodo da casa Park, meticulosamente fotografada para reforçar o abismo econômico.O filme acelera sem atropelar, revelando reviravoltas que soam inevitáveis apenas depois que acontecem. A fluidez entre cenas de humor, suspense e drama culmina num desfecho inesquecível, capaz de chocar e emocionar na mesma batida. É uma aula de como abordar temas complexos — desigualdade, facetas humanas, privilégio — sem cair em didatismo.Parasita é um marco cultural e cinematográfico, comprovando que o entretenimento pode (e deve) carregar uma mensagem contundente."
3,2025.07.05,"Parasite has been widely praised for its craftsmanship, and with good reason. Its cinematography is carefully composed, its symbolism is deliberately placed, and its commentary on class divisions is conveyed with clarity. A high level of directorial control is evident throughout, and the blending of genres is carried out with notable confidence. That said, an emotional connection was difficult to establish. The shifts in tone — though clearly intended — were experienced as uneven, and the progression of events often felt exaggerated to the point of undermining realism. Characters are presented more as archetypes than as fully human, which made empathy harder to sustain. While the film’s artistic merit is acknowledged and its themes are understood, the overall experience was felt more as an intellectual exercise than an emotional journey. Parasite may be admired for what it achieves, but it was not personally found to be engaging. In short, worth watching, hard to connect with."
4.5,2025.06.17,"I don't know why but i got soo easily attached to the story also weird film. very very weird. Well deserved of ""Best Film 2019"" tho."
5,2025.05.13,"Parasite is a masterclass in directing and screenwriting. Bong Joon Ho's direction is meticulous, using every frame to build tension and highlight social themes. The script is brilliantly layered, seamlessly blending dark comedy, thriller, and social commentary. The dialogue is sharp and the narrative structure keeps you engaged from start to finish. Both the directing and script work together to create a film that is both entertaining and thought-provoking."
5,2025.05.04,"Bong Joon Ho's masterpiece ""Parasite"" deserves every accolade it has received. The directing is absolutely flawless, with each frame meticulously composed to enhance the film's themes of social inequality. The way Bong uses vertical space to represent class hierarchy is brilliant - from the cramped semi-basement of the Kim family to the architectural marvel of the Park residence. 

The script is equally impressive, seamlessly blending genres from dark comedy to thriller to social commentary. The dialogue is razor-sharp and the narrative structure is perfectly paced, with shocking twists that never feel contrived. The way the story gradually shifts from lighthearted to deeply unsettling is a testament to Bong's exceptional storytelling skills.

What elevates this film beyond mere social commentary is how it refuses to paint its characters in black and white terms. Both families are sympathetic yet flawed, making the inevitable collision all the more devastating. I give it a perfect 10/10 - a true modern masterpiece that rewards multiple viewings."
3,2025.04.22,"Film with a particular and functional atmosphere. The plot is good, not banal and not predictable and with an excellent development. Overall a good film and a good story really appreciable but nothing sensational"
3,2025.04.13,"It's ok, not bad, but certainly not great.  Very over-rated, presumably because of it's Oscar.  Some decent enough acting, although the storyline is very predictable quite early on. Worth a watch I guess, although I wouldn't rush to see it again!"
1,2025.03.08,"As a huge fan of Snowpiercer, I had incredibly high hopes for this film. Hopes that were far too high, and far too unrealistic. What the hell is this story. And what's the point?Parasite feels new, fresh, original.. all of the things that likely earned enough attention for so many so much acclaim. But where is it all going?It's kind of an anti-hero tale. This family is pulling off a multi-layered, clever con on this gullible, innocent family. And as the main characters, you're kind of rooting for them. Or, at least interested and invested in their story and where it's **** concept is not my favorite, but it holds water as far as a plot goes. However just as you are wrapping up at 2:00, and wondering where this plane is going to land, the film takes a wild unexpected turn for the worst. And now you're wondering what kind of film you're watching. Is this thriller? Is this horror? Is this drama? Is this mystery? The plot twists along the way are catchy in their own right, but lacking heart, these genres don't quite all come **** fact that this film won Best Picture at the 2019 Oscars is baffling... beyond me.What little message there is to this film leaves you hopeless, questioning purpose and the future. Not the kind experience I'm hoping for at the cinema."
0,2024.12.29,Eu não sei como uma porcaria dessas consegue receber 4 oscars. Filme não serve nem para passar em uma sessão da **** de tão ruim.
5,2024.10.06,"Godlike show that deserves its praise. No question!!!!!!!!!!!!

Amazing story and setting. The pacing and ending are masterpieces"
4.5,2024.09.24,"A relatively simple, low-key racket spirals way out of control as an impoverished lower class Korean family weasels their way into the lives of a wealthy, naïve, white collar household.

Unpredictably composed, Parasite shifts effortlessly between several genres, evenly mixing comedy with tragedy and several stops in between. Of the versatile tools in that particular box, the film's at its best on the frequent occasions that it ratchets up the tension. I constantly caught myself holding in deep breaths, completely immersed in the moment and conflicted about the best possible outcome. Not all of those nail-biters lead to fireworks, and the film is careful not to overplay its hand, so that, when the time is right, the inevitable explosions land like a flurry of unexpected body blows.

The first hour is captivating, as the leeches' shady plot comes together and their long con gains momentum, but the home stretch, with its string of sharp curves and grim consequences, is unrestrained chaos in the best of ways. One helluva ride."
4.5,2024.09.03,"An amazing movie that keeps getting crazier and crazier until the very end. It starts as something, then evolves into something else, and then into something else. It is an amazing story of a poor family that turns into an amazing horror movie about a poor family. It needs a watch."
4.5,2024.08.28,"Incendiary filmmaking.  A watermark for modern-day suspense that combines social commentary, cringe comedy, and nail-biting tension in ways that are exhilarating and unprecedented.  The cast is terrific, with Song kang-ho, Park so-dam, and Cho yeo-jeong all standing out as highlights.  The script is razor-sharp, with every set piece and character decision leading to jaw-dropping results.  The Kim family is sympathetic, but their actions often veer squarely into anti-hero territory.  Bong joon-ho is a master of his craft.  There are some shots in this movie that belong in a museum, including one framed mostly in darkness near the end of the movie that will take your breath away.  The pacing is perfect, with every ounce of tension mined from each scene until the consequences of the Kims' actions comes to bear.  Run and see this one, and get ready to be wowed."
4.5,2024.06.17,I've never tried Asian movies but my friend recommended me this movie. But this one was better than some Hollywood movies. It made me think about poor side of the world and how they struggle day to day until the day they die. It made feel sorry for those poor people and really encouraged me to help those who need help and support. I started helping local poor people with my friend. Highly recommend this movie.
3.5,2024.06.17,"After watching the trailer, it seemed like a movie made to keep watching the movie with simple plot, no serious disturbing things, and once you start watching the movie, you understand the plot and wait for what will happen after this event. After watching the movie, there may be movies that end in such a way that I thought it would end like this."
5,2024.06.16,"Энэ бол зөвхөн Бонгийн л бүтээж чадах кино юм: догшин ширүүн, сүүлийн үеийн капитализмын утгагүй зүйлсийг хатуу шүүмжилсэн хэрнээ хөгжилтэй, хэзээ ч цочирдомгүй.  Энэ бол оны шилдэг кинонуудын нэг юм."
5,2024.04.22,"Parasita é um clássico instantâneo, o melhor filme do século 21 e um dos melhores de todos os tempos!"
5,2023.12.27,"Masterpiece. A gift for Humanity. 
Do you want to see what's inequality about ?
Take a look. Enjoy."
5,2023.11.17,It starts off slow. Almost decided to watch something else. I read other people’s reviews and had some patience. It just gets crazier and crazier in a good way. Solid film.
