5.0,2019.10.18,"It's not really a review but my attempt to explain how I interpreted the movie to those who complain that the film is overrated, especially if the reason is that they didn't like the second half of it.

It's much easier to understand the message of a movie when the 'good guys' win or the 'bad guys' get punished in the end. I'm not saying that all Hollywood films are so naive in their portrayal of moral values. But still, I believe that Parasite is much more subtle than most other movies that people are accustomed to watching in which there's a character with a clearer 'moral center' whom audiences can easily relate to. So, I think it's no surprise if the message of this film had failed to register for some of the audiences.

Some complained that they don't understand Ki-Taek's motive for killing Mr. Park. But to fully appreciate this, you need to understand the meaning of a recurring expression in the dialogue which is, ""crossing the line"".

It's a deliberately ambiguous phrase that can either read as one should respect other people's privacy or as one should mind one's own (social) position instead of meddling with the affairs of those in a different position. If interpreted as the latter meaning, it can serve as another image that emphasizes the subject matter of the narrative, along with more easy to notice the metaphor of the two families' respective dwellings.

It would probably have satisfied such audiences who expected more lighthearted drama if the movie focused on an underprivileged, but more likable family exploiting a cold hearted snobbish family in a comical manner. But the movie would have lost all its genuine charms if Bong Joon-Ho chose such a path, and he is too good a director not to see such a danger.

Instead, he chose to make Mr. Park a reasonable enough character, despite his occasional hints that reveal his true nature. He seems to treat Ki-Taek fairly enough at first, but he also warns the latter not to 'cross the line' if Ki-Taek attempts to pry into his private life.

At first, it seems that it's quite easy for Ki-Taek and other members of his family to sneak into Mr. Park's house in various roles and mingle with them. Ki-Taek even compliments how nice Mr. Park's family is, but his premature admiration soon gets challenged when he overheard, when he was hiding under the table, what Mr. Park really thinks of him - almost a different species of the human being who doesn't even smell like him.

Ki-Taek's final disillusionment came when Mr. Park cringes from the smell of the dead basement dweller and shows much more concern for his son's shock while virtually ignoring Ki-Taek's daughter's status who's dying on the ground, spurting blood from the stab wound.

That moment, Ki-Taek realizes how Mr. Park sees him and his whole family as not an equal human being, but something much more insignificant.

And he also realizes the 'line' that separates the two families is not just that of courtesy or proper social behaviour. Instead, it is a line that can even determine the life of those 'lesser' human beings to be less important than the passing unpleasant feelings or mental shock of those 'proper' human beings.

However easy it was for Ki-Taek's family to sneak into Mr. Park's house, or however they try to socialize and mingle with Mr. Park's family, their existence is no better than that of a 'parasite', which is also visualized so effectively by the presence of the hidden basement room inside the house.

With such disillusionment and anger, Ki-Taek chose to kill Mr. Park, as a parasite could to its host, and like a parasite, he keeps hiding deep inside the dead host's body until he could claim the whole of the carcass and use it as nourishment for his offsprings.

The tragedy was not something caused by any exceptional defect or vice of either Mr. Park's or Ki-Taek's personalities. Instead, it's a 'line' drawn by an invisible hand, separating those classes according to their respective social conditions, which can be so brutal as to be able to deprive the two families of their humanity in contrasting manners. And that is what I believe to be the message this film is trying to convey.

Of course, not every movie must make a commentary on society rather than providing a care-free pastime that everyone can understand.

But without if the movie didn't change its gear in the second half to shed light on a serious inherent problem of our society, it would be just another heist gone wrong type comedy, instead of a deserving candidate to be called the best film of the year."
5.0,2019.07.05,"I am remarkably stingy with my 10/10 ratings. I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.

I'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.

What I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).

And it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast. All the characters are understandable and sympathetic to some degree; the amount of conflict, drama and tension derived from a narrative with no clear heroes and villains is staggering. You come to care for just about all of them.

I'm stumped to come up with any flaws for this movie. And sure, I've seen many movies that are hard to fault, but it's rare that a movie appeals to me on a gut level and excites me to this degree while also being so close to technically perfect. It's extremely entertaining, thoroughly moving in so many different ways, and as icing on the cake there's a ton of social commentary and some heavy themes to chew on once the movie's over (and this one's not going to leave my head for a while, I can tell).

Catch this one when you can and believe the hype. Joon-Ho Bong has made many great films (and so far no bad one's), but this even manages to stand head and shoulders above all the others.

When it comes time to consider what the best film of the 2010s was, this one will surely be up there."
4.0,2019.10.06,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that contained as many genres as 'Parasite'. The movie starts out almost like an 'Ocean's Eleven' heist film and then expands into a comedy, mystery, thriller, drama, romance, crime and even horror film. It really did have everything and it was strikingly good at all of them too.

I love a film that respects its audience. There are so many details in this movie that are crucially important and yet the film trusts its audience to notice them and acknowledge them without ramming them down our throats. There are a lot of layers to this film and I suspect for this reason its rewatch-ability factor will be very high.

The film was incredibly entertaining too. I can't think of a boring scene in this movie and yet on the surface for large parts of the film you would say not a lot is happening, at least in terms of action. Fascinating characters and brilliant dialogue are what create this. I had a great time with 'Parasite' and I think most that give it a chance will too."
5.0,2019.08.25,"In a meritocracy, success and fortune are reserved for those who deserve it--those who develop solid plans according to their talents and abilities and who execute those plans through hard work and determination. Anyone can rise to the top, and for some lucky Cinderella, plucked from the cinders and gussied up in gowns, the meritocracy represents the heights of perfect egalitarian society: ""I started with nothing and ended up with everything I ever desired; you, too, can achieve you dreams, if only you try.""

The promise of unobstructed sunshine at the top of the mountain becomes justification for bitter competition, backstabbing, deceit, and callousness. You climb the crooked ladder until you make it to the straight one, and then, perhaps, when you at last feel secure, you can afford to be kind and confident and generous. ""It's easy to be nice when you're rich,"" the mother in this film (Jang Hye-jin) at one point observes.

But it's a very long and very crooked ladder, and sometimes the rungs give out beneath your grip, and sometimes they've been dangerously greased by those who climbed before you, and sometimes the ladder itself is simply kicked down--either by those above you or, just as often, by those staring up from the ground below. There are a lot of people trying to climb that one ladder.

But in a meritocracy, you can't blame the ladder or the other people trying to climb it. Nor can you blame the fact that all the good stuff is kept so many stories up instead of down at the ground where everyone can easily reach it. No, you must blame yourself. You should have tread more carefully. You should have climbed more quickly. You should have used a firmer and more precise grip, anticipated disasters, and known just when to leap. If you fail in a meritocracy, it's all your fault. You should have tried harder. Better luck next time.

Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik), the young man who is the main character of PARASITE, several times refers to ""metaphors,"" and the film itself is, of course, a metaphor. On a surface level, viewers are treated to a very thrilling, engaging, well-paced and well-plotted crime story. At all times, however, bubbling up from beneath the slick surface of this genre film, there are deeply personal, meaningful truths that should resonate with almost any viewer. These insights are rarely foregrounded. They are so subtly interwoven, in fact, that if you're like me, you may be completely surprised when the final shots of the film roll and you realize that you are emotionally devastated by the intimate, humanist story you've just witnessed. Bong Joon-ho's filmmaking is so extraordinary here that he'll make you fully invested in the lives of his characters without you even realizing he's done so.

I want to avoid spoilers here, but suffice it to say that PARASITE is a masterpiece--beautifully lensed, enthrallingly edited, superbly acted, and intimately involving.

South Korea has a population that is one sixth the size of the United States, and that population is stacked into skyscrapers in an area slightly smaller than the state of Kentucky. Higher education is widespread, so parents with means try to make their children stand above the pack by hiring them tutors and signing them up for extracurriculars and afterschool programs. I lived in Korea once, and the children I taught there were sometimes engaged in learning ten to twelve hours a day, six days a week--public school, English-immersion private school, piano class, soccer team, taekwondo, math camp, chess club, and so on. I routinely worked sixty to seventy hours a week on salary, but at bars I would meet young men my age who were expected to work far more than that, who slept at their desks so that they did not need to pry themselves from work for too long. As the father (Song Kang-ho) in the film at one point says, this is a country where fifty young men with college degrees apply for a mere security guard job. One can't afford not to struggle.

The themes of this story are not just localized to Korea, however. They are the story of global capitalism, and the specter of American materialism (and imperialism; note the ""Indians"") looms heavily over the film. Meritocracy makes cannibals of us all. It's nice to dream, and sometimes the dreamers who plan and struggle well enough can indeed climb out of the basement and into the sunshine, and how nice an ending it is when they do. But the film also makes it clear that sometimes all that planning and dreaming may be, maybe, just whims and fancy. More often, it seems, our pipe dreams are content to leave us with nothing more than the whiff of spewed sewage."
5.0,2019.08.19,"This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece. It will make you belly laugh, it will chill you to the bone, and it will make you shed a tear. This movie will stay with you long after the credits are over.

If you plan on watching this movie, AVOID SPOILERS AT ALL COSTS."
4.5,2020.01.12,This is a well written and well perfomed original film. With a lot of repetitive cinema these day i felt this was something new. I felt connected and engaged with the character throughout the film. There are several well directed tense moments throughout the film. A popular topic of class struggled well portrayed. Its always nice to see foreign language films having worldwide success.
5.0,2020.02.04,The most original film of 2019 and it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie in quite a while. Class warfare at its best.
,2019.05.26,"Parasite (Gisaengchung), the 2019 film by Bong Joon-ho, taps into the tensions caused by the widening gap between rich and poor around the world.

The film, delivering a strong social commentary that can be interpreted at a universal level, follows two families on opposite sides of the social and financial totem pole. It is a darkly entertaining and suspenseful look at a poor but incredibly cunning family living in a filthy basement and the rich Park family, the polar opposites of our protagonists. The film makes you play a guessing game of which of the two families are the most rotten.

Winner of the Palme d'Or at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, Parasite shows the extent to which we go to in order to live a comfortable life. The devil is in the detail in this grotesque critique of social inequality and the psychology of money."
5.0,2019.08.19,Well written and performed also technically shines cinematography & bgm are too good and there's not even a single lag it's perfectly edited. Probably the best experience in recent times. Its pure art resembles the modern society the emotions they had shelved are insanely exceptional a layered masterpiece. If you like dark thrillers then you shouldn't miss Mr. Bong joon-ho's Parasite. Definitely tops the list of best movies in 2019.
4.5,2019.07.02,"As a film about a family imposing on another, and keeping dark secrets hidden beneath the surface, Parasite achieves what Jordan Peele set out to do with Us: tell a multi-layered story in a widely entertaining manner, but without sacrificing the believability of its central narrative.

That's not to say that Us is an ineffective film by any means, but when it comes to crafting weighty social commentaries under the guise of lighter fare, writer-director Bong Joon-ho is in a class of his own.

The film follows a lower-class South Korean family as they slowly integrate themselves in the lives of an upper-class family and their lavish household. As their entanglement is spun out of a web of deceit, the lowly family find themselves skating on thin ice when it comes to keeping up appearances.

It's a twisty satire on social-economic disparities in South Korean society that swings broadly in tone, and sometimes threatens to tip over the edge, but never feels less than meticulously calculated in its tonal shifts.

However, to reveal anything more about the story would be to take away from the overall experience, as each act is marked by a major plot twist or revelation that keeps the film one step ahead of the viewer at all times. Go in blind if you can and expect an unforgettable ride."
3.0,2020.02.19,"The film is interesting, but that's about it. The first hour was really slow, the whole class thing seemed quite familiar. I'm not sure why people are falling over themselves about this film, maybe since it was Korean yet with an accessible story and familiar film language that it suddenly moved westerners to 'see the light'? Anyway, the second half twists and turns struck me more as a wacky story line I would have seen on a soap opera back in the day like Young and the Restless or Days of our Lives. Overall, I'm more critical of the critics than of the film. I recommend seeing this, it's worth a look but all the Oscars and 'best film of the decade' stuff is incomprehensible."
5.0,2019.11.05,"Do you want to see a movie that will have your stomach in knots, anxious during many scenes? Do you want to see a movie that will have you conflicted on who you're rooting for? Regardless of your answers, see Parasite. Parasite ticks along quietly until it is booming in your ears. The symbolism varies. Sometimes it is obvious, Bong Joon-ho might as well have made the subtitles spell it out. But other times it is more subtle, and you might realize a connection or symbolism days or weeks after. Bong Joon-ho is a master at that. The conversation that it sparks is worth the $13-20 it costs to see the film. Parasite has made me think more than most films I've seen. Give it a watch, see it with friends or family and the dinner table will have a conversation overflowing with opinions and realizations."
3.0,2020.04.10,"1.This movie is too over rated, I don't know, maybe it is something wrong with me because so many people appreciates this film superlatively...

2. All the characters are pathetically unlikable. They only show flaws. You don't want to be them; you don't want to be with them ... not at the beginning, nor in the middle, nor in the end.

3. This lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.

4. I don't understand what the intention of the director is? What does he want to explain or to prove? Is it a critic of social inequalities? Is it a thriller? A comedy? I don't know and none of these styles is addressed adequately."
2.5,2020.02.27,"There are a few suspenseful scenes and a decent plot, along with comedic dialogue, but that's it. It's not a ""metaphorical masterpiece"" that some critics and users are saying. I feel as though too many people are trying to be expert critics like on that episode of South Park where the entire town writes crazy yelp reviews for all the restaurants."
,2020.08.16,"A poor family see an opportunity whenever their son starts tutoring English for a wealthy family - if they can engineer it, they can each get one of the jobs within the household. This is the basis for a film that starts out as a sort of con story, seeing the rich family as the 'marks'. As it plays out though, it keeps this assumption in the background, eating at the viewer as an idea, before then making it very relevant in the closing aspects of the plot. Between the start and then, the focus is on the various twists and turns of the drama itself. In this the film engages, and I found it easy to engage with it on the basis of what was happening.

The later develops do work better though when viewed in the context of the social aspect. There are lots of clever critics that can talk to you about the meaning and hidden depths of commentary from the film; for me the key one was the falseness of the 'con' itself. Although the family mock the gullibility of the rich family, it is not like they are stealing money from them, or somehow dislodging them from their position in life - no, they are just providing labour to them in exchange of comparatively low wages. They are doing this at the expense of other working people just trying to keep a job, and the rich family could probably not care less about the 'truth' as long as their needs continue to be met. This aspect is important for the direction of the later stages of the film, and adds sense to what happens and why, but it is interesting in and of itself. Technically the film looks great, and the director builds mood and tone well. Performances are strong across all the cast, but the turn from Song Kang Ho probably was my favourite as he was the most subtle and had the most space to shift across the running time.

There is a lot of talk for Oscar recognition, but it is a handsome, clever film and the timing in the year is right - I don't see it being the first foreign language film to win best picture, but this is more to do with the system than with the film. Regardless of awards or not, it is an engaging drama, with unusual developments, and built on top of an intelligent social aspect which links well to the direction of the narrative."
5.0,2020.11.01,"PARASITE is an excellent effort from Korean director Bong Joon Ho, a talent I've long admired since seeing THE HOST over a decade ago. He's had his ups and downs over the years, although they've generally been ups rather than downs, but this is perhaps his towering masterpiece. It's a quiet and reflective work, his maturist yet, a parable playing out which looks at class divide in a scathing and extremely telling way. The issue is universal, which is why this film did so well abroad (and at the Oscars), although I've been championing the quality of South Korean cinema for a long time. The technical qualities are exemplary and the acting is particularly astounding, with an unusual storyline building to an unexpected climax. A film that thoroughly entertains as well as making you think."
4.5,2020.01.16,"This is a movie about a class struggle in South Korea, like what movie ""Us"" attempts to do but done properly. It is a stark reminder of what true living standards for most South Koreans look like, and its realism is very painful. Few are aware of the fact that up to the 1980s, South Korea was in fact more impoverished than North Korea, and it was only late that the situation reversed with famines of the 90s etc, but many people still live miserable lives, and situation is very similar to that in China, where a few got gloriously rich but the urban masses still live in bug infested cheap dwellings.

Some crafty members of this underclass manage to con contemptuous rich man into employing them as his servants. For many Asians smell is a way to express utter contempt, and this is often directed against the white people, who, being able to process milk, smell ""like butter"" and are seen in rac ist light as unclean, but the same rac ist contempt is directed towards the poor. The poor accept these valuations and fight for the crumbles, like roaches in the dark, but in life and death situations, resentment might boil up and the contempt might cost the rich their empty heads.

The movie paints a sad picture of modern East Asian societies, with many subtle points, criticizes their culture and emulation of the America, with a few cruel but precise strokes. The sheer talent of the Korean filmmaker, but also the fact that West likes movies from foreign countries that are self bashing, allowing the worst condescension rooted in colonialism that failed miserably in East Asia to thrive, one more reason to cheer this slightly overrated movie."
4.5,2020.01.30,"""It's so metaphorical"" is what Kevin says when they show him Da-Song's paint, he makes a statement without knowing absolutely nothing about what he is talking about, most critics of this movie say exactly that ""It's so metaphorical"" obviously Most know what you are talking about, when writing something about a movie I have to be 100% sure that I have understood.

""It's so metaphorical"" This comment on this movie is quite fair and precise; Parasite is built on the basis of visual symbolism that for some it will be an easy task to find them and for others a little more difficult because it also does not put this type of visual metaphors in the foreground, sometimes leaves it to the public's interpretation and in others simply play with the camera and film techniques to tell us the story, a clear example is the first time Kevin visits the Park house, the house is shown in a low-angle shot from the ground showing the superiority of the house and the environment over the character, the rain scene in the middle of the movie is simply wonderful: the family plummets to its miserable reality and the camera descends in a peculiar way, as there are many examples throughout the film; the fight over the cell phone in the Park house looks like an animal fight, the shots in the Kim's house are closed and in the immense Park house they are open and wide, a lot of voyeuristic Hitchcokian shots and provocateurs of vertigo, the symbolic use of the stairs throughout the film, something quite coherent since the film speaks especially about the socioeconomic classes and the social and race stairs, are some simply steps over others. Who are the real Parasites? the Kims or the Parks? the film plays with this question and leaves the answer to the interpretation, the Kim who represent the great majority of the poor class in Korea and in the world act as parasites that will gradually owe the class that is above them, taking advantage of the comforts that it offers them without any difficulty, living under the ground and in precarious conditions, but on the other hand the Park are practically useless beings, there is nothing they can do: their children are educated by others, their clothes are ironed and washed by others and their food is made by others.

Kim's family at least shows that Kevin is good at Languages, even better than many college students, his sister has great skills that lead her to create the perfect plan, even she manages to do what no sophisticated teacher did; control and support Da-Song, but due to their poverty their hopes that they can take advantage of this kind of talent are minimal. The final shot of the movie plays with us and gives the perfect blow to culminate this story: Kevin writes a letter to his dad that he probably won't be able to read, while he has a dream, after the dream the shot is the same that of the beginning, he It shows the exterior of the house from the basement this time without sun, showing that he it is where it began and that now its life is dark and empty of hopes."
5.0,2019.11.04,"This movie is so masterfully written and presented with a large cast that older audiences will realize how rare movies like this have become. Its enjoyment comes from getting to know the members of two extremely different families, one very poor, the other very rich. How their lives come together is the wickedly enjoyable first half; then, in the second half the house of cards begins to shake and finally collapse with a fury we both dread - and perhaps even enjoy. Though our enjoyment probably has as much to do with the movie-making skills than with the nasty turn of events in the violent final scenes. If you see only one foreign language film this year, this should be it. Exciting and provocative throughout, it is wonderfully acted and packed with significance for all who live in a polarized society where so many live in luxury, while others live in comparative squalor just a few blocks away. Deserves all the accolades it has already - and surely will continue - to receive."
4.0,2019.12.28,"There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.

If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.

The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.

There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.

For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance."
4.5,2019.08.17,"What an amazing film! Clearly an essay on the class divide. Writing lovable but nasty people is tough, but perfectly executed here.

They quite clearly cross the line, and when I mean ""they"" I mean bother the working class and the upper class. You could easily argue that ""parasite"" refers to one family trying to suck another family dry. Or that the upper class is draining the labour of the lower class, and expecting them to be grateful about it too! There is also something about the American Indian theme, a metaphor for dying cultural traditions which are being replaced by modernity? Nature is dog eat dog? Or is it a homage to an ""idyllic"" past where Native American culture was relatively classless?

Either way a must watch if you can handle subtitles!"
3.0,2020.03.04,"This film doesn't allow easy reviewing because it has many aspects, many ways to look at. Is it thriller? Comedy? Drama? Societal critique? It's all of it; and therefore none of it. All in all, I was underwhelmed and mildly frustrated.

The style is there, I grant it. Cinematography is great. Acting is awkward at some points, but it's OK because of the partially comedy-like nature of this film.

But then, there is a problem with story telling. It builds up nicely toward the middle, where the parasites settle in their host and discover the secret down below. And then it makes an unexpected turn. It's alright to make a surprise at the end (I'd even say it's good), as long as it flows reasonably from the preceding story line. A reveal must make sense once it is revealed. This one didn't do the job convincingly for me. We are given very little clue about why people acted the way they did at the birthday party.

This film is just fine, but no masterpiece in my opinion. Some films are so easy to understand to the point of being insulting; others are so obscure to the point of being pointless. Great films do it just right somewhere in this spectrum. Unfortunately, this one is leaning to the pointlessness."
4.0,2020.02.03,"Parasite (2019)

With the hype around this movie (""best in ten years"") I had unreasonable expectations. This is a funny, almost silly story with great acting, and with a couple of twists that make it inventive. It's also filmed (photographed) with gorgeous care, lots of gently moving camera, a lot of planning of shots from one to the next to tell the story visually. It's an example of classic great moviemaking. I thought the acting was especially sharp, like the complex job the leading woman, Yeo-jeong Jo, had of seeming a bit ditzy and selfish and yet not completely lost at sea. And the rest of the cast played types that didn't tumble into stereotypes. The story was smart enough to give them room to be complex, but this isn't a probing complex movie, actually. The content is in the improbable situation and how it leads, almost in a Chaplin-like building of absurdities, to comic tension. The cameraman, Kyung-pyo Hong, deserves credit, for sure, because he holds the visual structure together in a range of scenes-racing down dingy steps, a downpour in the slums, and graceful geometry in the fabulous house. Director Bong Joon Ho deserves the praise he is getting. That said, the next thoughts are more a reaction to the praise it's been getting: there are more impressive movies out there in various ways. Even just this year there are movies that have movied me more, or made me laugh more, or were more inventive. (I'm not naming movies.) Maybe since this movie manages all three it's notable, but I'll keep my admiration in place! Enjoy it!"
3.5,2020.04.12,"It was entertaining, with good execution. But best picture?

Some people seem to love the fact that it switches masterfully between genres, which to me seems like something that would excite a movie geek or critic more than it would a regular viewer.

Others delight in the ambiguity of not quite knowing whom to root for - while that might distinguish it from a stereotypical ""american"" narrative it hardly elevates it to some exalted status. To its credit, I think the strongest feature of the film is that the director brilliantly manipulates the viewer's emotions by superimposing classically sympathetic elements onto the objectively non-virtuous and indeed villainous. What seems relatable and sympathetic in the moment is actually part of a pattern of deeply objectionable behavior, while what seems moderately dislikable is actually fairly mundane. This incongruity is layered on to brilliant effect.

Now, many are praising the supposedly deep, revelatory social commentary on the nature of class struggle, but I don't find it nearly as profound as is claimed. The overtly sensational, absurd plot if anything detracts from the relatability of a social message, and the storyline (even leaving aside the over-the-top scenes that are exaggerated for cinematic effect) is chock full of innumerable ordinary lapses, discontinuities and implausibilities to the point of distraction. More importantly, the characters are all minimally developed and characteristic of a one-sided view of the world in which people act out their base grievances and fantasies over a veneer of class-determinant normalcy. It strikes me that there is little to no consideration of virtue, even in momentary antithesis. Yet if this is the social revelation then it is a deeply cynical one, and also an implausible one because the world is not so one-sided and simple. For this reason, the film ends up revealing very little realistic insight into the human character or social dynamics. It is not a bad film as it is well executed and clever in its emotional manipulation, but I am not willing to dole out gushing praise."
2.5,2019.12.31,"This movie is not a ""masterpiece"" by any means. And all the apparent hype it's getting? Why? Is it because this is a foreign film trying to be an ""American film""? (That is, trying to be an American ""genre"" film?)

THE GOOD:
The actors are good.
Some good cinematography. Definitely some cool scenes, like the flooding late in the film.
The twist near the middle of the film is a good twist. However, it's like 50 minutes in, and it's too late. The film is semi-boring up to that point.


THE BAD:
We've all seen those less-than-stellar films, where the criminals make one stupid horrible decision after another. Not the comedies where it's supposed to be funny or dumb, but the serious films. And you sit there thinking, ""Man, these criminals are effing morons, it's just NOT believable. You've seen those, right? Well, this is one of those.


I could suspend my disbelief over one bad decision, even two. But every single one? It's just not believable, because the criminals are good at pulling off their cons and getting all employed by the wealthy family. But once they're all in and making buck... then they all become stupid? Doesn't work.

The bad decisions start when the wealthy family goes camping, and the criminals decide to hang out, get drunk and make a mess in the wealthy family's living room. Even one of them foreshadows the wealthy family coming home unexpectedly by mentioning it as a ""what if."" Next bad decision is they let in the former housekeeper who shows up unexpectedly. Really??

Then the next bad decision is how they handle the housekeeper and her husband. Once the criminals are being held hostage by the threat of disclosure, why wouldn't even just one of them think of trying to negotiate something? Oh, sure, one of them eventually does, but like 30 minutes later when it's too late.

The film feels too slow until we get to the twist in the story. Twist should really have happened within maybe first 30 minutes. Not halfway through the movie. And then, when it does happen, we're down the road of the criminal family making multiple bad decisions.

Minor point, but the housekeeper's husband who's been living under the house for something like 4 years, looked too healthy. Someone living in cave-like conditions for 4 years with no sun, is not going to look healthy.

All in all, not the worst film I've ever seen, but NOT deserving of the high praise and ratings it's getting here. And not deserving of the Academy Award for Best Picture. Sorry."
,2020.02.09,"In my latest IMDb review, I wrote the following;

""1917 is British director Sam Mendes' latest opus. I also believe that it is the next Best Picture, and that he is worthy of his second Academy Award statuette for directing.""

Don't get me wrong, 1917 is a splendid and absorbing war movie. But after watching Parasite, I no longer agree with my earlier statements regarding Oscar statuettes ...

Parasite is perhaps one of the most unique films I have ever seen. One second, it is a hilarious comedy, and in the other, a terrifying horror flick. Suddently, it turns into a romance and then you find yourself watching a jaw-dropping thriller. The greatest thing about it, is that you don't even notice these dynamic changes in genre. The natural flow of the movie is just so beautiful.

I don't even know how Joon-ho was able to craft such a film as Parasite. No single shot is wasted, the intelligent script is baffling and sometimes the characters feel even more alive than real people.

Some complain over the fact that the film is in Korean, and that you end up reading the subtitles more than watching the actual movie. I find that statement to be nonsense. Maybe it is because I am quite used to reading subtitles that I find it to be so (I am from Sweden), but perhaps also because the acting is just so good that you know the feelings of each character just by looking at their facial expressions.

To conclude, I wish for Parasite to win five out of six possible nominations at the Academy Awards tonight;

Best picture: Sin-ae Kwak, Bong Joon Ho

Best Achievement in Directing: Bong Joon Ho

Best Original Screenplay: Bong Joon Ho, Jin Won Han

Best Achievement in Film Editing: Jinmo Yang

Best International Feature Film South Korea

I believe that Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood had better sets, but in all honesty, what is it compared to Parasite ?

I would not hesitate to put it in my top 10 best movies which I have ever seen. And, it is probably, the greatest movie of the 2010's. Read no further about it, just watch it. You will be delighted.

5.0,2019.11.12,"Parasite Hollywood Theater 11/11/19

I've seen Parasite three times in five days. I think something may be wrong with me. It's just so good, even after repeat viewings the high-tension scenes still hold so many thrills. Bong Joon-ho has made a perfect film. I've seen it so many times I've memorized the characters lines so I can watch them almost the entire time without having to read the subtitles, this made the movie even more enjoyable. I just wanted to write some aimless thoughts about the movie, pretty much conversing with myself here, but feel free to read. Oh, and we definitely get to major spoilers so avoid this if you haven't seen the movie.

Yeo-jeong Jo, the performer who plays Mrs. Park is such a gem. Her hysteria and earnest simplicity make her a joy to watch. Her face is so expressive and bright, there is a scene where she is walking up a flight of stairs and is witnessing her maid have a pretty disgusting coughing fit and the look of sheer disgust and revulsion on her face is so hilarious. She is the introductory cornerstone to the relatability and identifiable nature of the ultra-rich Park family.

My favorite character is still Mr. Kim played by regular Bong hitter Kang-ho Song. The way Bong directs his performers seems to be relaxed as he's said Song would do multiple takes and each performance would be wildly different until he settled into what they felt was right. This proved to be a real challenge for editor Jinmo Yang, who would have to composite different takes into each other to make them work. For example, Song may have had an over the top take, but Jo may have had her best take of that same scene. Yang would digitally edit the scene to meld them and get the best performances from both actors. It's seamless to us, but to Yang that's a lot of pressure. Personally, this was cool to learn because we recently had to do this on a short film I worked on, good to know larger productions do this too. It's fascinating to watch Parasite with that in mind because Song's Mr. Kim is such an eccentric character and watching the other actors react to him is a treat. He's the least predictable of the entire family and seeing his various reactions and how he absorbs what's going on around him is captivating. During this screening I really took in his expressions and his motives for the actions he takes at the end of the film. They really clicked and made sense to me this time around. The way Song processes pain in his face is deftly subtle and minute.

That pain we see paints a much larger dark mark across the underlying themes of the film. The title Parasite doesn't take a genius to decode. The poverty-stricken Kim family is very much in a symbiosis with the Parks. The Kims are driving them around, tutoring their children, cleaning their house and cooking their meals while Mr. Park's salary alone pays all four members of the Kim family. Which is insane to think about, that distribution of wealth is ridiculous. There is a line from Mrs. Kim, she says Mrs. Park is nice because she is rich, and how if she were rich, she would be nice too. She also likens money to an iron, smoothing out the creases. Which is an apt analogy, sure we all have heard money cannot buy happiness and images of the sad billionaire conjure up in our minds. We can say that money doesn't buy happiness, but money does buy us breathing room, it sands the sharp edge of reality down. When you're broke and down and out, everything seems like a threat. It seems like one strong wind, or in the case of Parasite, one literal storm can obliterate any stability you might start to create or what little you had to begin with anyways.

A beautiful, heavy rainstorm is admired from the top of the hill where the Parks live, only to completely flood and destroy the semi-basement where the Kim's live. All that gorgeous rainwater flows downhill from the mansions and directly into the slums, consuming the entire Kim apartment. The next morning in the car Mrs. Park is mindlessly chatting away on the phone saying how much of a blessing the rain was and how clean everything is, she also takes notice of her driver, Mr. Kim's, unpleasant smell. Unbeknownst to her, 8 hours previously he and his children were neck deep in flood water mixed with raw sewage trying to salvage family photographs and prized possessions, all of which fit in a single box. The most striking shot in the film is Mr. Kim's daughter calmly smoking a cigarette, perched on top of a toilet violently spewing black filth. Cut back to the luxury Mercedes, Mrs. Park rides in, pinching her nose and rolling down a window, only for Mr. Kim to almost lose it. His face deftly registers exhaustion, anger, jealousy, and pain, the emotions revolve around his face like clockwork. Parasite messes with perspectives of reality and how your wealth measures how close to reality you really are. Mrs. Park isn't a villain, her wealth just acts as a warm, protective blanket of ignorance to the suffering around her.

The tragic comedy and irony of Parasite goes even deeper. As the ending events of the film lead to Ki-taek (Mr. Kim) going into hiding, while his son Ki-woo, and wife have both now caught legal reps. Ki-woo writes a letter his father will never receive. He vows to buy the mansion his father is hiding out in. The bitter reality has me asking what kind of opportunities will a person with no formal education, no trained skills, and a criminal record have? What shot will this kid get? The friends who joined me at the screening were hopeful for Ki-woo's future, I however was not as optimistic. Yet the most compelling element of Parasite is that with the world it creates we really don't know what the future may have in store for the Kim family. It's a self-contained, grounded yet fascinating and strange universe we get to inhabit for a two-hour segment, and a world I will continue to revisit many more times."
5.0,2020.01.10,"It isn't every day that you come across a movie like this, a practically flawless one in my opinion actually. I have nothing but praise for director Bong Joon-Ho and I can now see why this movie has received much hype and praise over the past few months. This is a movie which not only shows a contrast between the rich and the poor but also the human condition and the will to survive. Don't worry, this review won't have any spoilers whatsoever.

To begin this praise train I have to first and foremost praise the acting of lead actor Choi Woo-shik whom delivered an incredible performance throughout this movie and brings a sort of charm during the first act of the movie.Another standout would be Kang-Ho Song that remains a recurring cast in the movies directed by Bong Joon-Ho and his consistency in the various movies he has directed absolutely shows why the director has so much trust in his acting capabilities.

A transition scene in particular which occurs at the end of the second act is really a beauty in itself and the transitions were absolutely stunning and beautiful which brings me to the cinematography and movie editing of the movie. The pacing was consistently on point where everything, even the change in tone is seamless. Along with the cinematography in which this movie is beautifully shot from the aesthetically pleasing rich kid house down to the semi-basement house in the suburbs.

Furthermore, another beauty of this movie will definitely be the score which was composed by Jung Jae-il which manages to convey emotion and tension during the second and third act of the movie which is something truly remarkable. Through music there are also hints to the sudden sort of change in tone I shall say which begins within just about the middle of the second act of the movie.

The plot of this movie is something I've yet to see over the many years of watching movies and this is where praised should be absolutely given for this ambitious plot where I could simply say, nothing written and the direction of this movie which keeps you guessing as to what this movie really is about should you dive deeper than the way the movie was promoted within the trailers shown for it. It is nothing short of extraordinary as you are unable to really see the change in tone coming.

At the end of the day, this movie questions how the rich could help the poor and in fact portrays mankind's strive for survival which in this case would be a better life in such a way that it isn't in your face. Plus, by the end of the movie, you really realise there is no real protagonist or antagonist, just people. People trying to live a happier life.

Thus, making Parasite the perfect movie where I am unable to criticise a single thing in this movie. Director Bong Joon-Ho has definitely earned my trust in his artwork and should to some extent be placed amongst the greats."
4.5,2020.02.09,"I rated this a 7 yesterday but after a full day of thinking about it, I must say it's really good. Slow burn, it has everything in it. Unpredictable and makes you react outloud"
4.0,2020.02.08,"The film starts off as a Lucille Ball/Vivian Vance escapade and ends as Quentin Tarantino drama. I guess that's what we call fluidity. Parasite is terrific. The cast is embraceable. The actors were recognized by the Screen Actor's Guild for the ""Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture."" Hurray for Parasite."
4.0,2020.02.09,"We find the prosperous Park family to be the occupants of a slick, scando-sheek home in Seoul, Korea. Mr Park is a fantastic provider for his family; in quintessential Korean fashion; as a tech entrepreneur. His wife and two children seem not to be in want of anymore than they already have. Despite this, his family are precariously vulnerable to social exploitation. His youngest son, who 'saw a ghost', is now subject to seizures. His daughter is a hopeless English language student who only sees her tutor classes as an opportunity to get a boyfriend. Finally his wife is highly impressionable and not fully competent to tackle the issues of her two children. In addition to whatever jobs he has created at work, Mr Park employers a driver, housemaid and English tutor for himself, his daughter and his wife respectively. All of these seem to be happy in their employment.

The Kims are another family of four but, for reasons we are not sure of, live in very basic accommodation in a poor part of the city. None of the family have solid jobs but it is not explained whether this is due to fecklessness or sheer bad luck despite best efforts. Lack of ability seems unlikely in their case as we see that they are very clever, albeit in a Machiavellian way. For example, they are happier to trick their way into getting paid for doing a bad job then actually folding the pizza boxes correctly.

The English tutor at the Parks home recommends to the son of the Kims to temporarily replace him as tutor to the daughter of the Parks on the one condition that he leaves her alone for him to ask out when he returns. This soon snowballs into all members of the Kim family shamelessly exploiting the Park family and their employees. Their crimes are as follows:


Forging an official university document and using it to gain employment.
Exploiting and encouraging the mis-diagnosed mental illness of a young boy.
Getting two people fired by destroying their reputations.
Stealing food and alcohol.
Murdering Mr Park because he didn't like the smell of a man who:



Lived underground for 4 years
Had a barbecue sword of meat sticking out of him
Was dead


The Parks weren't perfect but nowhere did they claim to be. What they were was a respectable family who contributed to society in a positive manner. The Kims were a clever but immoral family who continually made bad decisions at key moments, bringing their downfall on themselves.

Unfortunately the parasite was so entrenched that once its downfall became the downfall of the host."
3.0,2019.10.03,"Before I attempt to justify the reasoning for my rating, I must provide a disclaimer professing my appreciation for Bong Joon-Ho's past work. ""Snowpiercer"" was the film that marked him on the map and allowed me to discover his other films, which turned out to be every bit as great as Snowpiercer was. I'm a huge fan of his, and I was extremely thrilled to hear of his unanimous Palme d'Or win. He's a great filmmaker and has the experience to show for it, and I'd say winning that award had been a long time coming for him. However, after my boundless anticipation for this film, and finally getting the chance to actually watch it, I was inevitably itching with a feeling of disappointment.

I've read many reviews of this film, all of them flooded with unworthy praise. Many people have stated that this is one of the best films of the past decade, filled with ""metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout."" Others have stated that the film takes numerous twists and turns, and unfolds in ""satisfying, unexpected ways,"" leaving the viewer wondering what's gonna happen next. The former sentiment's mention of ""metaphors and allegories,"" and the way they are presented in this film, have been done countless times over the course of mankind's brief existence, and class conflict has been a recurring theme in anecdotes for centuries even before Marx introduced his theory, yet people still find this elementary concept somehow elusive. There's only one dramatic moment that could be deemed a ""twist"" in the film, which ultimately wasn't that surprising given the endless amount of times this corporeal narrative device has been used since the dawn of storytelling. Besides that moment, everything is utterly predictable. I don't understand how people can act like the film is some unprecedented feat which challenges themes never challenged before. Seemingly every Hollywood blockbuster thriller presents a concept not that dissimilar from the concepts utilized by Bong Joon-Ho for this film.

Additionally, ""Parasite"" suffers from glaring screenwriting issues, the most blatant one being an over-reliance on convenient narrative tools to artificially move the story forward, rather than letting it flow naturally. I'm not going to spoil what exactly happens, but as an example, there's a certain set of stairs in the film that acts as the focal point for the story's progression. Characters make uncharacteristic mistakes that are beyond the realm of believability, which sacrifices the film's sense of authenticity and causes the tension to feel forced. Using gimmicky writer's tricks like this can make or break a film, and if anything, it shows a sign of sheer laziness from everyone involved in the screenwriting process, Bong Joon-Ho obviously included.

Creativity is another criterion that I exceptionally value when judging a film, and ""Parasite"" lacks in that department as well. Simply put, it's a perfectly capable film made by a perfectly capable director. Nothing more, nothing less. On the absolute surface level, it's a supremely entertaining movie, and if you're typically non-analytical and you prefer shutting your brain off before watching a movie, then this might actually be a great popcorn flick for you. But as far as the artistry goes, there's nothing to really be had with this film. Bong Joon-Ho's prowess behind and in-front of the camera was to be expected: The performances, the cinematography, the quirky lines of dialogue, etc. But with the exception of the expected, every aspect of this film is totally unchallenging and risk-averse.

All in all, I'm still content with Bong Joon-Ho's Palme d'Or win, more so for the excellence of his early work than for the film that actually got awarded. Do I think there may have been some politics/hidden agenda involved behind the scenes at Cannes? Possibly, especially considering the flak he got two years ago due to ""Okja"" and its affiliation with Netflix. Regardless, in the grand scheme of his filmography, I'd rate ""Parasite"" towards the bottom rung in his otherwise exemplary résumé. And if you're curious, I'd rate ""Memories of Murder"" and ""Mother"" at the tippy top, which shouldn't come as a surprise."
4.5,2020.08.07,"Usually I don't read reviews before seeing a film. This one, however, I did, and happily so. First of all, it was good to know what cinema in Korea is all about. We need to shed our cultural biases, including ""how"" to make films. This had a very clever plot and an engaging group of characters. The title, I assume, means the principle figures have managed to infest a body and then use it to sustain themselves. I hope to see more from this director in the future."
1.0,2021.12.23,"The film started off well and an interesting concept started developing However , it suddenly turned into mayhem and utter stupidity . It was nonsensical .

Yes, I got the message about the rich and poor divide etc etc but that's nothing new and just reality . I was disappointed in this movie as I'd read great reviews. It was an utter waste of time !"
4.0,2020.02.01,"This whole film reminded me of ""10 clover field lane "" . It starts out and you think you know where it's going .. 5 turns and 5 wrong conclusions later there you are at the end still wondering if you got it right .

It didn't feel forced or silly .. it was powerful .. edge of your seat .. wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the ""parasite "" or someone is to you .

Great acting .. great plot .. great twists . Worth the time . Honestly if I went in with lower expectations it would have been a 9 I was just expecting so much it was hard to surpass that .. but would highly recommend to anyone ."
,2020.02.10,"How has this film has won the best film Oscar? What a travesty. It's inane, rebarbative, empty, childish, overlong, silly, dull, cluttered and generally irritating. The social message, presuming there is one, is garbled, superficial and hollow. Everything is over-exaggerated to mind-numbing effect. How easily pleased all the people raving about this film are.

There's a dude in the secret basement flashing morse code messages every day on a light upstairs. It doesn't occur to anyone to fix the light. That's just one example of the intellectual level of the utter narrative drivel that we are subjected to here. It would take me too long to go into all the others.

It's bad enough that the Academy should be leaping on the 'it's different so it's great' bandwagon. I'm just afraid that the new social idiocracy that we now live in means that we will be subjected to this kind of clueless, jejune fantasy-comedy-horror melange for the next few years."
5.0,2019.06.27,"Oh man, what can I say... How do I describe this jaw-dropping masterpiece in just few sentences?

PARASITE (not mistaken with that outstanding anime 'Parasyte') is a socially conscious themed film that masterfully wrapped in comedy and thriller. It's an exciting and surprising ride from start to finish. The tone shifting in the second part of the film is done brilliantly. Eventhough there's so much stuff happening, Bong didn't lose control of his storytelling.

Most of the scenes are sure very relatable for many in real life. On top of that, the ensemble cast (featuring my favorite Song Kang Ho) deliver a top notch Oscar-worthy performance.

PARASITE is the worthy winner of this year Palme d'Or (and I also hope it will do well at the Oscar - Best Picture worthy? for sure!)

It's the best film of the year, one of the best I've seen in this decade and for me it's arguably one of all time classic."
4.0,2020.02.08,"Parasite is a fantastic movie that features sympathetic, yet morally gray characters and their plight to earn enough money to live. Despite the awful things the characters do, you feel for each and every one of them thanks to the fantastic writing and acting. The humour is also fantastic and always lands. Seriously, despite being a drama, Parasite is one of the funniest movies I've seen all year. However, the reason why I can't say that Parasite is one of 2019's best movies is the ending. The ending is so anticlimactic, disappointing and dissatisfying. It didn't feel like that was what the film was building towards at all. However, I still recommend Parasite as it's mostly a fantastic experience that I just wish had a stronger conclusion."
4.5,2020.01.10,"This was one of my favourite films, great acting, I liked the characters and there was lots of suspense."
5.0,2019.09.04,This movie lives in this time An amazing sweet thriller movie. Great in every single part of the seventh art especially in dialogues which are great no formality in them. Characters talk like ordinary people act like ordinary people they feel happiness they lose temper they succeed and they fail. And after all of these for converting a good movie to a great one you need to be in front of audience I mean the movie should conflict the audience mind and show them some facts. In this case facts are some of the most important ones in our modern life they are about class distinctions which is the difference between rich people and poor people that is getting larger every day and it is the greatest problem in my society finally when you finish watching this masterpiece ask yourself who is the real parasite? The poor family or the rich one which are sucking their stinky blood
5.0,2019.11.06,In starting 1 hours story is simple but then story make one after one thiller new type of suspance that's make this movie great . This movie can thinking everything many type of question & ending is super-level....
3.0,2023.05.12,"I had to leave a comment because I have no idea how this movie received an 8.5 rating. 6 range at best. As far as Korean masterpieces go I thought ""The Handmaiden"" and ""The Housemaid"" were far better stories about class. The script had tremendous ideas and I was looking forward to them ... and then they just dropped off and switched to a new plot. It felt very messy. There were scenes that had no follow up or no point. Like they had to fill a plot hole last minute. If hours of this film were cut, that would make sense. It felt like it couldn't decide if it wanted to be a dark drama, or a dark comedy. If it wanted to be just a family friendly dark comedy, you went too far, if you wanted to be a intense drama, you really dropped the ball. It felt like the director wanted to appeal to a wider audience by playing it safe. The more I think about it, the less respect I seem to have for its ""artistic"" merrit. Absolutely Overrated.

As I'm reading throught the miles of reviews, I'm convinced these are westerners who just started watching foreign films this year, or they're all paid. The common theme is people seem to think they are incredibly intelligent for having watched this. Another reviewer commented this is the SAME exact plot as ""Married with Children"" even down to Chicago, Illinois being a factor. Just blew my mind and now I have even less respect for the script."
5.0,2020.01.24,"Parasite is a masterpiece and it is worth all the attention that it's getting. The script is very flawless and the cinematography captures the beauty of how the production designed each and every place. The actors executed their part very well and whenever they speak in English really entertains me and give the mood a comedic atmosphere. The whole film is very mesmerizing to watch and how you get to have a light comedy at the start that turned real dark by the end was a perfect blend on how to play the audience's emotions and get them fully engage in watching. I gave the film a 10/10 because the way they made the film was smooth, clean, and gorgeous in a way that you could get drowned in the details of every part of it."
3.5,2020.04.09,"I found the movie entertaining. I was expecting more duplicity and schemes from the Kim family once they infiltrated the rich family. It moved slow at first but picked up pace towards the middle. While I was entertained, I was shocked that this movie won the 2019 Academy Award for Best Picture over the far superior 1917."
1.5,2020.02.16,"A veteran chauffeur, his wife and their kid wonders, one fluent in English, the other an art wiz with expert computer skills and mastermind deception skills, are all unemployed (!) and lives in a scummy basement, where they fold pizza boxes for peanuts. With wildly implausible easy they con a rich family (ridiculous caricatures of rich people who apparently got rich by being soooo stupid) into employing them. First the son, then the sister, then the father ... you get it ... sleep-inducing snail's pace to the predictable setup where the entire family has leeched their way into the rich people's home. Once inside the home, the rich family goes on a vacation, and the poor family literally start ripping the home apart in a stupid drunken frenzy?? The old housekeeper (which they got rid of in a horrible way, causing a dangerous allergic reaction) shows up, and for some reason they let her in?? Turns out the old housekeeper is keeping her husband in a hidden basement under the house, where he has been living for four years (best explanation to why is that he is hiding from loan sharks). He has been flickering the lights morse code-style which the small boy of the house has deciphered (but he never tells anyone and it is therefore utterly pointless). Each family now knows each other's secret, so they are in a stalemate. Right? Movie apparently forgets this, an instead we end up with a big fight. A lot of nonsense. A flood. Then a lot more violence. Poor father kills wealthy father (because of his arrogance towards the poor which have a certain odor), then leaves his own two wounded children to die, running to hide in the basement (he would actually have to step over his son, who lies half dead in an enormous puddle of blood in order to get to the basement, but I think the director forgot this - add it to the five million other plot holes!). At some point near the ending - where the movie takes another tonal shift towards the sentimental - I realized that we are actually supposed to sympathize with the poor family, despite how EVIl they have acted the entire movie ... This movie is wildly implausible, first half wildly predictable, full of weird tonal changes and plot holes. Everything is overly constructed to underline some muddled point about social inequality, but nothing really makes sense. I loved ""Snowpiercer"" but this is total crap."

Highly recommended, just go for it."
4.5,2020.01.24,"A 2019 south korean film that shows the contrast between two families from different spectrums of the hierarchies/classes and the how individuals can turn into parasites, the film also blended both comedy and dark disturbing tones very well, while also delivering stunning vissuals of the use of camera work done masterfuly."

Next to that is there are many genres in one. Also, in several moments it drives you to think about many things how would you react, gives mockery and shows the human nature, essentially."
5.0,2019.10.12,I heard nothing but great things about this film and upon watching it I had no idea what it was about or what to expected. I'm glad I watched it because it was like nothing I've ever seen before. I could definitely say it wouldn't be as impactful to me if it was American production with an all American cast. I would definitely recommend this watch!
3.0,2020.01.07,"The film is ok but that's as far as I go. It's worth a watch but only a score of 6 for me. It's not a masterpiece, it's not film of the decade it's not even film of the year. I don't understand how people can give it 10, 10 is a perfect score. 10 is unachievable in my opinion as nothing is perfect."
3.0,2021.05.25,It was not that good and not that bad for me. It's quite boring in middle of the movie but at the end it was good.
2.5,2020.03.18,"From the first scene this movie reminded me of Almodovar, but without the required intelligent effort to make it a credible story. Metaphorical? Yes and no, that's where they lost me. The pace seems fast, but then I found myself wanting to fast forward a number of times, since the overly simplistic plot turn into absurd rather too quickly. If this is the best movie of the year then Hollywood has a very serious problem."
,2019.06.09,"This cinematographic gem has been recently rewarded by the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes Festival. If I have one and only one advice to give you: go savor this fabulous movie with a strict minimum of information! Indeed, this film might schematically be split in two parts, the second one being quite surprising and unpredictable. The script is excellent and the casting is globally sumptuous, especially the gorgeous Cho Yeo-jeong for whom I may confess I have a crush.

As a postscript, an anecdote certainly insignificant but literally astonishing when you're French: in the middle of the film, the proletarian family gives itself up to an orgy, the coffee table being covered with manifold dishes including two French cheeses as industrial as cheap: « Le rustique » and « Bresse bleu ». Unbelievable!"
5.0,2019.09.29,"I expected a lot from Parasite (Gisaengchung) since it won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival and because i really like Bong Joon-Ho's previous films.

Still, it exceeded my expectations. It's a comedy, Drama, Thriller and Horror film in one. Sometimes there are films which you know are going to be liked by people who are film enthusiast, but not by the general movie going public who go to the cinema to be entertained. I think Parasite is going to appeal to both film enthusiasts and the general movie going public.

The cinematography and mise-en-scene are beautiful as it often is in Korean films; the style is very similar to Burning by Lee Chang-Dong. But the story is something else. During the first part of the film it seems like a comedy and makes you laugh, but then after a while the story becomes more and more serious and eventually turns into a thriller/horror. I'm not going to say more about the plot/story than that because i don't want to give anything away and because i think you should go into this film without knowing anything.

This film is simply a must watch!! No wonder it won the Palme d'Or."
5.0,2021.12.09,"When the buddy who got into college tells him he's moving to the US, and he's passing on the 14-year-old he's been tutoring -- just tell 'em you're enrolled in college, even though you aren't -- the son of a family so low class they've sunk through the foundation finds them very nice, very accepting, and very clueless. So he and his layabout family get all the help fired; his sister is hired as an art psychologist to help the sister, the father as the new chauffeur, and the mother as the cook/housekeeper. Yet even though you don't see them, there are vermin living in the foundations, and they come out when the people in charge aren't around.

It's a movie that starts out as a situation comedy and then abruptly changes gears into horror, with a script that handles the theme of the people we don't see because they're not our problem in a way that jostles the boundaries of symbolic and mimetic fiction in a very disturbing fashion. When I saw it in a theater during its New York run, I was impressed. I was convinced it would be nominated for Best Foreign Movie, and might even win!"
4.5,2020.01.31,"Bong Joon Ho's tragicomedy that is a ""comedy without clowns, and tragedy without villains"" (Ho, 2019) is a masterful painting of the division between classes and all the implications and ramifications that come with it. Parasite puts us in the shoes of a low class family and walks us into the life of the elite, making sure to land both class' realities and idiosyncrasies precisely and delicately through the superb acting, meticulous production design and breath-takingly purposeful cinematography. Although the bold and blunt screenplay narrates and exposes our lack of empathy in dealing with people of different classes, refreshingly, the shot selection during a small scene in the second act shows the interaction of a house maid and her boss through the differing perspectives of an adult and a child. In this sequence the directory of photography first shows us the perspective of the adult wherein she is looking over at the boss and her maid and sees a clear visual divide between the two. When the camera shows us the same scene from the perspective of the child, no such barrier is present, and they are on the same side. Bong Joon Ho has exquisitely created a universe that mirrors the realities of his home country today without knowing that the same story resonates through out the globe. Through the chaos that pursues because of the interlacing of these two contrasting families both in the film and in our everyday lives, I believe we need to go back to the mindset of a child wherein we stop seeing people as defined by their social economic status and strive to see each other simply as humans."
5.0,2020.02.07,"Parasite is a film that leaves one immediately wanting to reevaluate what they just saw. Expertly directed, written, edited, acted, and shot, Parasite is a unique and terrifying movie experience best viewed without any warning"
4.5,2020.01.24,"Much like it's creature name sake, Bong Joon-ho' s Parasite is a movie that latches on to you and won't let go. The story of Parasite revolves around a poor family that cons a rich family into hiring them and once the poor family becomes integrated to the rich family, the selfishness of the poor family starts to threaten everything. Multiple times in the film, We are shown scenes of the humiliation, abuse and the depravity of the poor family, the scenes themselves have a sense of morbid joy as they are so well shot and it feels so earned that its hard to look away. The shots are there to tell a story and not used as gratuitous fillers for shock value.

Parasite is a movie that challenges us to rethink how we live our lives and just how deep do we affect those around us."
4.5,2020.02.04,"I watched this movie three times. it was fantastic and masterpiece like everyone said. there are tons of videos about this movie/subtext on youtube. I was wondering, while the director was reviewing the comments, was it something similar he thought during the filmmaking process or are people going too deep. light/dark, high/low, smell, rich/poor all these contrast are just beautiful."
3.5,2020.03.15,I watched this movie. it's a good movie but i couldn't understand how it won the best picture. i think this movie doesn't deserve that for sure.
5.0,2020.02.02,"The movie was excellent in combining multiple genres like comedy, thriller & drama which is difficult to pull off. It definitely stood out of mass movie productions with its story, characters & plot twists.

Parasite has couple of things in its story which left question marks in my mind, but didn't effect it negatively.

My 10/10 is weighted by the fact that this kind of movie is very rare and the originality of the story leaves the viewer almost constantly surprised by the next turn of events."
3.5,2021.10.09,"The start and end felt rushed, but the film was generally enjoyable. Not sure why it was hyped quite so much, but definitely worth a watch, but it's unlikely to be a film I return to watch again."
2.5,2020.01.07,"Is the fact that people who voted for it to win the Cannes film festival award and those who gave it anything higher than a 7/10 on this platform, actually exist.

A family living below the poverty line in a 1st world nation whose kids couldn't pass the national exams or fold a pizza box would suddenly become world class con artistes overnight infiltrating a wealthy family? And when things took a dark turn, we the audience are supposed to feel sorry for them, just because they are poor, nevermind their greed, pride and total lack of character?

Please don't insult our intelligence, at least 1 out of 3 accounts here are real and still give honest review."
5.0,2020.02.02,"This is my first ever review. I saw it with my sister at the movie theatre. I never wanted to know anything about the movie in before hand and I've scouted the movie for a long time. Among the best movies I've ever seen. We were both laughing many times, even the slap stick could be funny. I had real hand sweat during scenes. The filming techniques are superb and a scene fade I've never seen before, gave me goosebumps. I like all the characters. Even though they are disgusting. I will see it again, Korean movies is something else, I love them."
4.0,2020.02.07,"Parasite is an exceptional, innovative and unforgettable movie in expression and form. Movie music is quite fit and suitable in every scene. It elaborates the dark side of social disparity masterfully. I have not seen such an intense and impressive movie for a long time."
5.0,2020.02.04,"I just want to leave my opinion on this masterpiece, I love films from South Korea, and what makes me love them even more are these films that leave me thinking for three days in a row, the fact that the film always has several meanings and is brilliant I love the fact that every little detail always has a meaning, they are films like these with symbolism, mystery and messages to make the audience think that they are the best films for me!"
5.0,2019.11.21,"Parasite is the heart-breaking and mind-shattering story of a poor south Korean family slowly inserting themselves into the life of a much wealthier one, through schemes, intense plotting and brilliantly written twists. Disguising itself, at first, as a comedy layered with social criticism, the film reveals itself to be a raw dramatic thriller verging on horror of great genius, with moments that will literally take your breath away. Bong Joon-ho crafts a near-perfect movie, with top-notch careful directing, beautifully flawed and intense writing, heart-wrenching performances and emotionally charged visuals. But in the end, ""Parasite"", isn't a comedy, it isn't horror, it isn't a thriller and it isn't a drama, it is FILM and that's what is so painfully gorgeous about it. 9,8 / 10"
5.0,2020.02.06,"One spoiler question. The father killed Park, went to the alley, ducked into the garage and slipped into the hidden basement. He then uses Morse code to communicate to his son outside the home. Did he not see his son in a pool of blood in front of the basement door? If he saw his son in that pool of blood why did he think he survived?"
5.0,2020.02.03,"Fascinating cinema that highlights how emotionally detached wealthy people can be. So many profound messages as it pertains to classism. Unexpected plot twists and all. I loved, loved, loved this movie."
3.0,2020.02.08,"After reading all the glowing reviews, especially about how this film is one of the best of the decade I had to see it for myself- the plot it self wasn't anything ground breaking, and while the technical aspect of the film were flawless and i enjoyed it for the first hour, the ending was a total let down (lots of plot holes that I won't get into here) I agree with some other reviewers, the Park family weren't your typical rich snobs, the father worked for his money and came home home and was always there for his children and polite to the domestics, the problem was the family was just too darn naive and foolish, but not terrible people by any means, all in all just a mixed bag, Shoplifters was a much more engaging and heart felt piece of foreign cinema, and I highly recommend watching that!!"
4.5,2020.02.01,"The movie starts slowly and shows us who the family lives. Despite the unmoral functioning of the family, that pretend to be someone their not to their benefict, after the major plot twist in the midle of film, the tension dont stop rising and the ansiety keeps increasing until a crazy final conflict. The resolution of the final dont explain to much but have satisfied me."
3.0,2020.02.29,"I've often thought that the genre mix of comedy - thriller is the most difficult to bring off. Somehow the two different kinds of reality, in their extremes, don't mix easily, unless the very nature of the narrative demands it, as in Dr Strangelove.

The comic first half is somewhat slow, and deals with the infiltration of a wealthy but naïve family, by a streetwise poor one. However, when the action develops along more serious lines in the second half, the atmosphere created in the first half still carries a surreal edge, and so I couldn't believe in the subsequent action sufficiently to be thrilled or horrified.

A brave attempt, but in the end I was left feeling a bit numb. It all seemed to lack any solid centre, with serious themes looking trivial, and comic themes looking disturbing rather than entertaining. All a bit tasteless, really."
2.0,2020.01.07,"This is not about social inequality. This is about a bunch of con artists who take advantage of a naive wealthy family. Its story is convoluted, far too long, and people are grasping to find depth. I've already wasted too much time on this so I'm not writing anything further."
5.0,2020.02.03,"What can one not love about this movie...the movie operates at so many layers of metaphors and ironies...the best that has come out of South Korea till date...expect some fireworks this Oscar season...#Bonghive

the movie basically portrays class divide in South Korea and symbiotic relationship between a rich and a poor family...the rich family is the proverbial host whereas the poor family...the Parasite!!!

The beauty of the movie lies a few layers beneath what is actually portrayed...how the parasite slowly befriends the host...and how it gradually morphs into something else completely...think of all the plot twists and their manifestations in society...specifically the relationship between the owner and the working class...just brings out global sentiments of Capitalism going crazy so beautifully!!!

As this movie is being released globally...I am sure the rankings and ratings will further improve...it was released in India around 1st Feb...this movie is a global phenomena considering the times we live in...Recommended...just go and watch this in your nearest theatre!!!"
5.0,2020.02.03,"After this movie, I'm now ready to search Craigslist for available jobs for me, my friends and my family. I'm also gonna build myself a bunker."
4.5,2020.02.04,"It's not a horror nor alien movie despite the title and cover. Nevertheless, the storyline kept me on edge the entire time. The concept is so interesting, even though it's common one. The development is very unique, and I was pleasantly surprised. There was never a dull moment!

Given the premise of the story, it was interesting to see the prevalence of the family bond in the movie. That aspect of it was very touching.

I found the ending good, but a little bland given everything the story went through.

Great movie, very psycho!"
4.5,2020.02.03,"This is my second viewing of Parasite and it's just as good as the first time I saw it a few months ago. It's been winning lots of awards and deservedly so. Ki-taek and his family live in a dingy basement and struggle to make ends meet, but when they see an opportunity to insinuate themselves into the wealthy Park family they devise a plan that, at first, is working like a charm. It's very amusing and with great performances, and you'll be surprised by the conclusion. This Korean film is about family and class division, and no matter how good a plan you have you can't plan for the unexpected. Parasite is the well deserved winner of the Palme d'or at last year's Cannes Film Festival."
4.5,2020.01.30,This movie shows desires of poor which is all same in any country of world. well acted and well made film.
4.5,2020.02.04,"This film is completely out of the box, a social critic that doesn't choose sides. An absolutely brilliant masterpiece that takes us to a roller coaster of emotions with some kind of new cinematographic genre, that shudder and leave us groundless in a state of deep reflection about the model of society in which we live in. For those looking for an innovative film, with an unusual style, and with a necessary and relevant reflexion, Parasite is the right and the better choice. Impressive work by the director."
3.0,2020.09.01,"This movie for me is a solid 6. It's obstacles are from critics reviews putting it at a 10. Its not that good and cant live up to those expectations. If you watch it , you wont have wasted your time. If you don't watch it, you won't have missed much. Its average."
4.5,2020.02.03,"This film is amazing. Mixes elements of comedy, suspense, and drama in a beautiful manner. I forgot I was reading subtitles after the film, as I was so engaged during the screening. Fantastic plot twists and very interesting and unique character developments. Would give 10th star if it weren't for a couple plot holes."
3.0,2020.01.08,"There are lots of great movies out there. This is just not one of them. Why? Because it's predictable to a degree that I have seldom experienced. All major events can be predicted way ahead of them happening, which makes watching this movie into nothing but a waiting game. It's not deep and it's definitely not clever.

If the director should ever reveal that he made this movie as an experiment to explore how hollow of a movie you can get away with and still have the world hyped, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised."
2.0,2020.02.29,"I wanted really to liked it ,but I couldn't. I liked only the last scene ,but I could not like any of the characters. I don't know if that was the purpose ,but for me at least one character has to be likeable. And all the poor-rich thing has been told better from soap operas."
4.5,2020.02.09,"Parasite is a deep, complex, layered, multidimensional and heartfelt portrayal of the class struggle and its gruesome ramifications existing in the present day South Korea. It is seen through a social prism where the haves are pitted against the haven'ts, the haven'ts are pitted against each other . It is also a subtle tale of the dangerous magnitude of the impacts of human greed and how nature backfires against a consumer culture. From the gift rock to the deluge towards the climax, Director Bong Joon Ho of 'Memories of Murder' and 'The Host' fame uses several metaphors to depict how nature backlashes against human's imperialistic pleasures . As a result, what starts in a mild satirical tone, climaxes in a disturbing manner, so much to the extent that even hours after finishing the movie, you can not actually get out of the eerie milieu of South Korean urban class struggle. This is no easy movie, let me remind you. But if you can finish the journey, it can stay with you forever, for the ample food for thought it offers. Truly a cinematic masterpiece from the ace Korean director. Predicting huge applause at the Academy Awards this year, may be the Holy Grail of movie making as well. A must watch for those who are cerebrally way ahead of the cheap DC Comics genre."
5.0,2020.02.01,This movie shows exactly how it is to live in a country full of structural violence. It shows perfectly the desperation of people in need to have a better life.
4.5,2020.01.21,"It was a great movie, a metaphorical pun intended to show the differences and/or similarities between the two major classes of the society, i.e. the rich and the poor. It has an extravagant climax which will not be liked by majority. However, the climax was justified afterwards. It was a great drama. I enjoyed watching it. Once the movie gears the pace, it was impossible to leave your seat without watching it full at one go."
5.0,2019.09.04,Didn't expect the ending...which is why I enjoyed it. Shades of the cult classic 'Old Boy' in the sense that there were elements that were so disturbing..
5.0,2019.08.18,This movie surprises you by every new scene. I couldn't say what genre the movie is but it delivers a whole experience. I had no idea what the movie is about in the beginning but it is worth it. Shows perfectly in a dramatical and comedian way the differences between rich and poor
5.0,2020.01.27,This movie surprised me by being near perfect. Struggle to place this movie in a genre as it is diverse and bring in a lot of themes. they nail the humour aswell as some of the deeper moments.
3.5,2019.10.15,"South Korean director Bong Joon-ho (""Okja"") says that he always tries to overturn viewer expectations and hopes that his latest film succeeds in this way. Palme d'Or winner at the 2019 Cannes Film festival, Bong's Parasite (Gisaengchung) does indeed thwart expectations, but the question is - to what end? Defying any strict genre classification, the film is a conglomeration of comedy, drama, satire, crime, horror, and anything else you can throw into the mix. Bong sees the film as a statement about the ""ranks and classes"" inherent in capitalism that are invisible to the eye, and says that the film ""depicts the inevitable cracks that appear when two classes brush up against each other in today's increasingly polarized society."" Unfortunately, the characterizations are filled with so many stereotypes that the lack of any realistic human dimension leaves Bong's statement without much impact.

The film looks at class differences between two families - one well-to-do, and the other n'eer do well. For the Kim family, life is a struggle. They live in a cramped bug-infested basement apartment without many amenities except for a toilet built on kind of a shelf. The father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho, ""Snowpiercer"") has failed in business and has accumulated many debts. His son and daughter Ki-woo (Choi Woo-sik, ""Train to Busan"") and Ki-jung (Park So-dam, ""Cinderella and Four Knights"" TV series) have repeatedly failed college entrance exams. The mother Chung-sook (Hyae-jin Jang, ""Adulthood"") along with the two children fold boxes for a delivery company, but cannot even get that right. Not to worry, they leave their windows open when the fumigators come around to get some free extermination and steal free Wi-Fi from the next door coffee shop.

On the other hand, the nouveau riche Park family has all the advantages. Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun, ""Jo Pil-ho: The Dawning Rage"") is the CEO of a high-tech company and the family lives in a spacious, modernistic home protected by sturdy concrete walls. He has an attractive somewhat fragile wife Yeon-kyo (Jo Yeo-jeong, ""The Target""), a teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so, ""The Tiger""), and a hyper-active young son Da-song (Jung Hyun-jun). Being wealthy and somewhat elitist in their attitude, for Bong, they are ideally suited to be torn apart by ruthless grifters. With the aid of a friend, Ki-woo is hired to be a private tutor for Da-hye. Of course, he has to forge university documents to convince the trusting Mrs. Park of his competence. With that conquest out of the way, the cunning Ki-woo concocts a scheme to secure jobs in the Park household for his entire family.

Convinced that their young son is a budding Picasso, Mrs. Park hires Ki-jung as an art teacher, then falls for invented stories impugning the character of their driver and housekeeper to provide some more employment opportunities for the Kims, this time for the deadbeat dad Ki-taek and his wife Chung-sook. Bong said that ""Sometimes with the characters in my films, I look at them cynically, but most of the time I have a lot of compassion for the characters, even with the villains."" This compassion, however, does not seem to extend to the loyal, hardworking household workers, their work scammed out of existence. Without going into detail, the whole escapade backfires in a twist that is over-the-top unsettling even though utterly implausible.

Worthy of a Mack Sennett comedy, a sweet family drama turns into a tumultuous melange of hidden chambers, revenge, bloody violence, a torrential rainstorm, people hiding under beds, and any other mayhem that may come to mind. To be clear, Parasite can be very funny and some of the satire is sharp-edged, yet it is hardly, as one critic described it, ""a masterful dissection of social inequality."" When asked what he wanted viewers to get out of the film, Bong said, ""I just hope that it gives audiences a lot to think about. It is in parts funny, frightening, and sad, and if it makes viewers feel like sharing a drink and talking over all the ideas they had while watching it, I'll wish for nothing more."" Enjoy the drink. In a little while, you may have trouble remembering what the film was about."
5.0,2019.12.01,"When a smart South Korea poor family decides to escalate the social ladder and take advantage of a rich family offering it suited services to their familiar problems firstly they have to displace the former employees. They did not realize nor the family living in the house that in the underground of it there was an atomic bunker. I was built to face any attack from North Korea. The brokers didn't say that to their clients to maintain the market price. Later on, the new employees well established in the house will find out that part of the replaced employees' family lives in this secret basement. The film displays the South Korea class conflicts as a metaphor for growing poverty engulfing the population with rampant disemployment. In this fantastic realism film, all social classes are placed in the same house: poor, middle class and rich. Old resentments and prejudices escalate as time passes. A revolution, interests conciliation or a violent upheaval without winners may develop as those class representatives have to negotiate when and how to enjoy this gorgeous house built by a famous Korean architect. This is a masterpiece."
3.5,2020.02.13,"As one other reviewer said, all the accolades have to do more with the idea other than the actual movie. TEchnically it is very well crafted, great cinematography, great acting, but personally I think overhyped. In a day an age where everything is political and has to do with social issues, a movie that very blatantly shows the disparages between rich and poor, (a little bit too stereotipically, I might add) is bound to get great reviews. Actors and their 200k bags of face creams like to feel they are connected to the poor massess, and social justice folk of Twitter feel they have been done justice, even if only for two hours on a theater. Hollywood wants to be that White Knight, and last year it paraded in their red carpet Mexican Native Yalitzia Aparicio, this year it was the Korean actors, I'll bet next year it will be another troupé. Like the rich family in the movie, minorities and other cultures are nothing but parasites to Hollywood, useful and good while they serve their purpose, stink bugs that have to be fumigated when they don't. No wonder 202 Oscars had the lowest rating of the last 25 years. Watch the movie for yourself and make your own mind, I don't think it is the 10 everybody is saying but its political message has provided the fuel to skyrocket it. Beware though, last 10 minutes are quite gross and gory."
1.0,2020.02.09,"Don't get the love people have for this movie. It starts as predictable slapstick comedy, then takes a sudden turn into a bloodsport parable on class warfare, and then then finishes -- can you guess? -- Nihilistic irony! Oh, that is really original, isn't it? All of the characters are unlikable, one-dimensional, amoral, lemmings. Apparently, Korean free enterprise economy makes them this way and their personal aspirations, ambitions, and accomplishments are simply results of circumstance and luck, as the wealthy and the poor are equally dimwitted, amoral, and self-interested."
5.0,2019.10.30,"Simply put, there's no way to explain what a masterpiece of satisfaction this movie is. Just watch it. I don't even want to explain what it's about...I think it's best if you just blindly go into it. Completely expect it to win best foreign film at the oscars."
5.0,2019.10.21,"I just watched the movie and found it simply wonderful. It is a mix of moments that happen as fun, joy, tensions and sadness. The climax scenes of the movie are breathtaking and all extremely well fitting, you realized it was no trick of the script to make those scenes happen, everything flowed very well. I'm amazed at the movie, a lot of people need to see this work for yesterday!

NOTE: The counterpoint of the rain scene is ""because of the rain the rich can't get to camp"" and ""because of the rain the poor are obliged to camp (in the gym)"""
5.0,2020.01.11,"This Korean-language movie was such a contrast with the drivel Hollywood churns out. The story was great, the acting was great, and the director maintained tight control throughout. I must see more of Mr. Bong Joon Ho's work."
4.0,2019.08.09,"Following the step of Get Out, it is a powerful film that comprises of metaphors and allegories which need you to think beyond a certain level as they are manifested throughout. No worries, you will understand the film even if you fail to unlock the codes unlike Mother! & Us.

Parasite welcomes the audience into multi-genres and tonal shifts that mix and take its turn after every act. Pure comedy, dark comedy to heavy dramas, horror, thriller, mystery, you name it. The director, Bong Joon-Ho wonderfully converts them smoothly without letting the audience feels bizarre of the transformation.

With merely 10 characters into play, Parasite brilliantly executes layer after layer of interesting character developments which progresses the plot forward to ultimately produce a comprehensive film.

Parasite professionally handles cinematic tricks to synchronize every possible element for the greater good such as excellent use of cinematography techniques with superb artistic values, information-packed dialogues, lavish architecture production designs & vibrant colours.

Quite certain scenes feel a little too long and weary. If they can cut short and add new scenes instead, the pacing will be better and more entertaining.

Majestic musical set pieces is utilized in the background to help produce a richer tone to the distinct elements.

The suspenseful moments would have you at the edge of your seat without noticing until the point you recall your experience inside the hall.

Verdict: A strongly crafted masterpiece film on social themes and satire that finds its place in audience's heart.

In short, it is one of those episodes of Black Mirror."
5.0,2020.01.12,"So much to unpack. incredibly thoughtful and clean cinematography. Well written script. Masterful suspense, so many metaphors! the music in the suspenseful scenes was so good that you barely noticed it until it was over. I was captivated through the whole movie.

I thought that there might be some symbolism of North Korea/South Korea as well as social class, but I haven't seen anyone else point that out, so it could be me grasping at straws.

For the main family, the film ends in essentially the same situation as it began, minus the father and daughter. Ki-Woo and Chung-Sook are presumably still struggling, at the bottom of the stairs again. Everything that happened in the film did nothing but take half of the family away. Thus describes Bong Joon-Ho's ruthless realism; the poor get poorer, and life continues on with no plan to fix anything.

Not that that matters, it wouldn't work anyway."
4.5,2020.01.12,"The only thing i would change on it ,is the end... , why the hell all that had to happen, the movie would be great with a different end.

Overall this is quit intresting to watch... , to understand the culture , the limits between poverty and rich people , there is more but i don't want to spoiler it , so it worth to watch.

The movie ended in hurry somehow ,not showing the life of Kim Ki-woo , i like that for the first time i see quality into this korean/chinese/japanese culture movies recorded .

This movie is pure fiction , but is not feeling like it couldn't become a real thingh , because doesn't look that unrealistic to happen .

I note it for 9 , because i would give it a different ending and a part 2 ! ,but maybe the director of the movie didn't had same vision as us tend to have .. , he wanted something sad to happen and the movie to don't end in just a happy end."
3.0,2020.03.20,Movie is over rated. Its an average movie. Don't know why it created this much buzz.
5.0,2020.02.04,"Finally saw this much talked about film. As a fan of Korean thrillers, this film surpassed my expectations. The film is about a poor family who cleverly n cunningly become employed by a wealthy couple, posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.

The film begins like a dark satire, it then proceeds into a captivating thriller n ends like a surreal crime.

The film is very entertaining inspite of the sad stuff shown about poor fellas but mind u, it is not at all demeaning. It is very gripping n weirdly hilarious."
3.5,2020.02.16,"Good movie, interesting story line, but never in a million years could win a oscar for best movie of the year...Political decision for sure! that's the world we live in unfortunately."
2.5,2020.02.18,"I'm sorry but I must be living on another planet - I can't understand why this film won an oscar and why some are rating it a 10. I felt a little bored in parts and I felt uncomfortable. Reading some other reviews after the film, maybe there were some aspects I hadn't analysed and worked out intellectually. But then still I felt it was totally over hyped."
4.0,2020.01.12,"The movie Parasite is one of the many films that reinforce why people should give up this ridiculous thing of not watching foreign films. People are so scared of subtitles that they are missing out on some of the best films ever made. After 5 minutes of subtitles you get used to it and don't even realise you're reading.

Anyway back to this movie. Parasite is a fantastic film that really has no set genre as you will experience a drama, thriller, romance and horror all in one! Unlike most films you actually can sympathise with 99% of the characters even if they are seen as more of a villain. I wont give anything away but I will say that Parasite is a must watch and one of the best movies of 2019!"
4.0,2020.01.22,"What a great movie. No words. For very long moments I was so immersed that I forgot I was watching a movie. The plot is greatly crafted. It always moves forward and escalates. When the story requires it, the tension is remarkable. I think the father's reason to kill Mr Park could've been established a little clearer, but anyway the movie is great."
5.0,2019.10.11,"You will watch it and you know it has subtleties It talks about how poor and rich ""nice"" people see each other It doesn't bore you for a single minute It is the best this year"
5.0,2020.01.24,"Parasite is a melody of fine cinema. It hits all the right notes that attracts its audiences with just the right amount of everything it has to offer. Each sequence delivers the perfect pacing relative to the ongoing conflict, accompanied by beautiful cinematography and scoring. The cast delivers an engaging performance that brings a sense of true harmony with each other. It also combines all forms of genre really well without it being cramped or overbearing. It excels in nearly all creative and technical aspects, but what truly captivates its viewers is its masterful storytelling. Overall, Bong Joon-ho has crafted a beautifully dark and chilling story that transcends language and connects with millions. The film deserves all the praise that it gets not only for its impeccable storytelling but also for setting a greater standard in the cinematic landscape."
5.0,2020.01.22,"I spent some time with the movie ""Parasite"" tonight. It captured me in it's symbiotic web. I'm sure there is not a single adjective that could describe it adequately...so I won't attempt that magficent accomplishment. Parasite tugged on every ounce of my acquired knowledge in philosophy, literature and Korean (yes...I do have a very tiny bit of that :) ) The set design was amazing...and it may give 1917 a run for it's money.

The stairs...oh so thoroughly magnificent in the simplicity yet the most complex of ""metaphors"" (yeah, I made myself giggle on that one.) I was instantly reminiscent of my Philosophy 101 ""Allegory of the Cave""....""I went down."" Thank you Herr Hanak.

Okay, I've lost all of you, I loved this movie for the Best Foreign Film...mostly because my theater neighbors tonight ate every kind of snack bar food possible...I will have nightmares about the gnawing, they chatted and checked their phones throughout...then they pottied and were able to read the screen....and then they seemed confused. Wonder why.

My feeling about awards..knowing the methodolgy of the voting....this film will not be best picture on Oscar night."
5.0,2019.11.02,"Oh man so I love this movie. Beautifully shot and exquisitely acted. Parasite is funny, tugs at the heart strings and is super dark just like I like my films. The director Bong Joon-ho has delivered yet again. I'm in on everything thing else he makes. Go see this movie in the theaters while you can and if you miss it, definitely watch it when it's streaming you won't be disappointed. Parasite is a 10🙏🏻"
,2020.01.21,"Parasite is a unique movie. I don't know if it's a true masterpiece, or one of a kind (indeed), or just a piece of masterful craft. Bong does everything he wants while telling his stories, and he's the only one I know who can do that aside from Tarantino. The plus here is a very sound moral. I will think a lot about Parasite, and maybe watch it again. This is the first time in 100+ reviews that I don't feel I can correctly rate a movie, but surely it is in the 8 to 10 stars range."
3.0,2019.12.20,"I think there's a really good movie buried in ""Parasite"" somewhere, but I gave up trying to find it. It has the same problem the director's previous ""The Host"" had: the pacing is broken.

That's not all, though. People have written about the movie's unexpected twists and turns. The thing is, it keeps you waiting far too long for these to arrive, they are too few and far between, and too unbelievable. The first major twist happens about an hour in, and seems to come out of nowhere.

The parts of the movie detailing how this horrible family coordinates an incredible con on the rich Parks are the best bits, though they are far fetched: how can people with the ingenuity to do that be such losers beforehand?

But then that first twist hit and the movie lost me increasingly, until by the end I wasn't even paying attention.

Pity. Some of the sequences were brilliant."
5.0,2019.09.18,"I will just say this first. If you are planning to watch this film, stop right here and watch it now before reading anything regarding this film because trust me you want to watch this without knowing anything not even the synonyms.

Now, directed by Joon-ho Bong who also directed Memories of Murder and Snowpiercer, Parasite is a dark comedy thriller which mixes various other genre. Its really hard to describe this film. I would compare this with Quentin Taratino films like the title suggests. But even then this film has a lot of direct message to audience and themes which is very easy to notice. That aside Joon-ho Bong has also upped his game in terms of the structure and storytelling. So much so that at first viewing you won't notice the hidden details and metaphors this film presents. The name ""parasite"" is just one of them. At the end you will be thinking who the real parasites are. Is it the rich, the poor, their expendable need for a better living or the house itself? Acting wise I dint see a single false note by any actors. The main standout was of course the father played brilliantly by Kang-ho Song. Writing is however what makes this film so great. You can see when the director wrote this film he thought of everything. There is not a single loop hole. Every character choices make sense, everything falls into place even when it seems to bizarre yet it seems so completely realistic just because just how we got to that point.

There is so much this film tries to say and you can see the director succeeded it gloriously when you think about it. The social structure with the way we live, our understanding and psychology at looking at people who live differently, our priorities and what we value. Joon-Ho Bong makes sure viewers will think after each act is completed and make your own judgement of what happened. He has completely turned a genre on its head. A film about social class has never been made like this before.

Still, this film may not please to people who just want a happy ending feel good movie. Without spoiling anything till now I will say that the first half is completely different to the second half. If you are the type of person who can handle violence and shock in a film then I will recommend this for you. If you are the person who want something different and original other than what hollywood keeps throwing these days I will recommend this for you. If you think film are not just for entertainment but for the art itself I will recommend this for you. Film industry need to keep investing on visionary directors like Bong Zoon-Ho and you might just get a masterpiece like this once in a while."
3.0,2020.01.27,"This film is either a love or hate review. I get that most that hate it maybe didn't understand the message - I did, but it was written in a mind-boggling illogical plot-hole ridden way. What makes it even worse, is how great it was from the start, that when the ridiculousness kicked in, you become extremely disappointed. There are so many ways this could've been written much better - and still get the message across, and maintain the initial theme without tanking. Directing and cinematography were excellent, and the casting on point. And the 132 min runtime was flying by, until the plot started to tank. Clearly over-hyped and not worth anything more than my 6/10"
1.5,2020.07.29,"I think the great cinematography has tricked audiences into thinking this film is a whole lot deeper/more groundbreaking than it actually is. It has the plot of a rom-com with some gruesome flourishes at the end that allow people to turn this into some type of incisive social commentary. Wow! Class differences exist! Thanks Bong Joon-ho for enlightening me.

Just because you've successfully deciphered what the director/writer sought to convey doesn't mean he's necessarily saying anything profound. People need to stop patting themselves on the back for understanding the meaning and realize that, despite the pivotal role of the underground in the film, its significance remains painfully surface-level.

I see a lot of people separating this movie into halves--and it's fitting. During the first half I was fairly interested and as I saw it taking on the plot structure of a lighthearted comedy where we willfully accept unrealistic events, I started wondering how the hell it had won Best Picture (alongside the universal acclaim).

Well, after the former housekeeper's return, the stupidity that ensues (yes--that moment and the very end inclusive) signals a dark shift that is surely what summoned most of that praise. However, it's here where the film starts to break down for me.

We accept the gullible mother and seemingly passive father as the opposite family begins to infiltrate at every opening. That's ok for some time, for some genres, but I simply cannot find the absurd a fair foundation on which to build a tragedy. The existence of the first half of the movie makes it impossible to take the second half as seriously as we are supposed to. And on top of it, I genuinely don't care what happens to any of these people (save a tinge of regret for Mr. Park's taking a knife to the chest), I find it impossible that the tutor-son could survive two (2) skull-crushing throws of a rock to the head, and I genuinely cannot think of anything stupider than Mr. Kim committing the murder in the first place, even given the heat of the moment and his motivations.

I was almost peer-pressured into giving a higher review for the simple fact that I've seen none so low as mine, but 3 just feels right. Something unconnected that I need to insert; the comedy element that seems to be so present to others isn't even there for me either. It's smirk-with-one-corner-of-the-mouth funny throughout, but never really hilarious. It's prettiness is its strongest feature and to say otherwise is contrived."
5.0,2020.01.19,"I know a lot of people have skipped this..... because nobody wants to read subtitles for 2 hours. I hope you are reading this.... And I hope that you can shake off your earlier reservations.... Please watch this.... Movies like this are very rarely made nowadays. Doesn't matter what genre a person likes.....this has it all.... Comedy, Love, Family, Thriller, Crime, Horror. What an awesome movie !!!!"
5.0,2020.01.22,"With Parasite, director Bong Joon-Ho creates an fantastic piece of cinema, that never lost my attention once. This movie makes your think it is going to be one thing and then it becomes something totally new. It's fresh, it's clever, it's shocking and it's satisfying. There is a scene in this movie that concludes the first act in a way that can only be compared to watching a Tetris game where every piece falls into its perfect place one after the other. Around the middle point something is revealed to the Audience that totally changes the path the movie was going on and from there it's an unrelenting roller coaster ride. Bong Joon-Ho also writes some fantastic characters, each of them getting their own perfect moments to shine. Not one character seemed out of place or without reason. They all had their place and brought different layers to the story through their actions and ideas. The actors of course help in bring this characters to life amazingly and the entire cast kills it to the maximum degree! Parasite is a film wonder and must be seen by all."
5.0,2019.10.19,"The working class and down on their luck Kim family struggle to make ends meet. When a friend of the son, Ki-Woo's, who is an English tutor for the daughter in the wealthy Park family, has to leave his position, he recommends Ki-Woo for the job. Now having an ""in"" with the wealthy family, the Kims begin plotting the downfall of the current household servants and inserting themselves into those vacant positions, making them all gainfully employed and with money finally flowing into the household. But not everything is as it seems in the Park house or with their previous servants.

This movie starts out as a comedy and quickly goes into social commentary, pointing out the differences between the poor working class family and the wealthy privileged family. The differences are ones that get commonly pointed out with the well-to-do having what usually gets termed as first-world-problems, while the poor family is literally trying to survive and save meager possessions in a flood. It doesn't shy away or try to be subtle about it, but interestingly enough, we don't feel beaten over the head with it either, which is a major change from the ham-fisted approach taken by most filmmakers. Couching this in a comedy is a good approach, as well, as the audience's guard is let down and we become more receptive to the ideas.

However, I do say it's MOSTLY a comedy. The third act takes a dark, dark turn, and the contrast, not to mention general disdain and even indifference, between the classes becomes much more severe. This gets into some hard territory, and characters that we've found quirky and even come to like in some ways show very different sides of themselves. At the same time, it doesn't feel unexpected, almost like we could tell that this was under the surface all the time and tried to ignore it, but aren't surprised by it when it does show up. This is some masterful characterization!

Another aspect of note is that this film is rich in allegory and metaphor. It's a smart film, yet at the same time the filmmakers are not condescending about it. They give the audience credit for being able to understand the symbolism and don't spoon feed you everything, which is a refreshing change from the usual head-beating most filmmakers go for. At the same time, they understand that not every audience member will understand or immediately pick up on every symbol, but they have crafted this so carefully and so perfectly that you don't have to understand each and every one. That understanding merely enriches the experience, but isn't essential to it.

This film has gotten some recognition, and deservedly so. It is rich, intelligent, and polished to a degree that we sadly don't see as often as we should nowadays, showing the filmmakers are masters of their craft. This is easily one of the best films I've seen in 2019. Highly recommended!"
5.0,2020.01.02,"I read a lot of rave reviews about this before I saw it. I also saw it on many ""must see"" lists the past month, so I thought, alright I'll watch it, and approached it with a ""show me what you got"" kind of attitude. It didn't take long before I realized that I was watching something incredibly different. In fact It is incomparable with anything I've ever seen before. It belongs and at the same time doesn't fit in in any kind of genre. It is as thrilling as the best parts of Gone Girl and is everything Jordan Peele's Us tried to be. I would say that this is the most divine work of cinema I've seen in many many years.

Some people refrain from watching foreign language films. I find myself paying more attention to the plot since I have to read what is being said. This is very beneficial to a film that demands your attention at every single moment, which this one does.

Parasite deserves a 10/10 because of the very simple reason that I wouldn't want to change a single second of it, everything had purpose. So watch it, I bet it will exceed any expectation you might have from reading all of these reviews."
4.5,2020.01.22,"For me, Parasite is most convincing because of its confusing story, which is especially convincing because of its untypical pattern, so that it's hard to tell which genre you just saw. The script remains clumsy and at least gives me an oppressive feeling at the end. Moreover, the film is very nice to watch because of the staging and because of the convincing acting and set design you can put yourself in the movie's shoes and put yourself in the shoes of the characters, which are all put on with a lot of love."
5.0,2020.01.24,"An instant classic! It's a rollercoaster of emotions that makes the heart pound and the breathing hitch. Parasite follows a poor family who have methodically and charismatically inserted themselves into the lives of a rich family, but even the best laid plans can go wrong and the parasitic family find themselves in deep trouble. Somehow, these characters are very likable despite all the things they have done to get themselves to the ""top"". The performances delivered by the cast is phenomenal, and nothing negative can be said about what they brought into the film. Dialogue is very engaging and riveting, it makes the ears wide open to be able to hear it all. The story is well executed and well paced, there is never a dull moment even during the more quiet scenes. The editing and sound is masterful as it adds more to the film's atmosphere of tension and ease. The statement it makes on the economic social classes is clear and can keep someone up at night. Overall, it is one of the best films I have ever seen and it is one of the parasites I am happy to have in my life."
,2019.09.05,"Huge Oscar Winner?! What a JOKE!

There's no way or simply not enough to convince me that this 4-member family could have so easily conspired a big scam to wreck a rich family. The two screenplay writers, one of them was the director Bong, simply borrowed the mass majority feelings of the 99% struggling Koreans who deeply hate the upper 1% rich class people in Korea and made up a story that rendered a catharsis masturbation-like feel-good opportunity for the poor, a self-righteous, self-justified, self-indulgent revenge on the rich class.

At the beginning of this movie, this lowlife 4-member family was at bay and struggled to a barely survived condition, the husband/father was unemployed for a very long time, the wife was nothing but a mean heartless woman, the son and the daughter had failed the college entry exams for so many times. This helpless and hopeless family couldn't simply become a well practiced con-artist family overnight. If they were such great scammers, they would not have fallen so low and so helpless for such a long time. They were just like you and me who don't have money to afford a dignified basic living standard. They would not be possible to suddenly become expert con-artist so easy and so soon.

The most shameful scenario was the screenplay writers/director who made the rich people looked so stupid, naive, emotional fragile and so easily to be conned, they completely overlooked the fact why and how rich people became rich. The differences between the rich and the poor are many, but usually, it's because the rich people are smarter, more intelligent, more cunning, 1,000 times sharper than the poor, they are not so easy to be manipulated, conned, scammed, or swindled, otherwise they wouldn't become rich and successful. Yet this stereotyped shallow screenplay simply overlooked these facts and made the rich husband and wife so stupid and so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers who didn't even know how to make a basic living or how to pass the college exams.

The screenplay made the rich wife a fragile, naive, shallow emotional wreck, but totally refused to admit that rich wives usually are split-hair sharp, otherwise they'd not be able to handle their social status. The husband in this movie also showed that he's a hardworking super smart self-made businessman and entrepreneur, he should not be so easy to be manipulated by a bunch of losers. Yet this movie, again, simply overlooked the realistic fact and made these couple an easy moronic target by the scammers.

In summary: Zero Probability & Highly Unlikely! The long-term helpless 4-member losers were absolutely impossible to become a well-experienced, well-organized, smart grifters/swindlers. How possible these 4 lamers to could br so abruptly, so suddenly become so smart, so organized, so skillful overnight to carry out their scam step by step? It's against the basic logic and absolute impossible.

The director/screenplay writers just used the majority poor peoples' hate/resent/bitter feelings against the minority rich people psychology, manipulated the poor audiences to have a catharsis moment in the movie theaters. If the audience in Cannes Film Festival gave a 10-minutes standing ovation, it only showed the majority of the audiences were also the majority poor, they finally got the opportunity to have a small window to vent their bitterness against the rich, so they were so generous to award this one-way street movie the grand prize.

I don't know why the Korean movie makers are so obsessed in this kind of con-artist/imposter/swindler/fraud genre movies. Ah-ga-ssi (Handmaiden) (2016) is almost the same like this sucker, but that 2016 movie is even lower and abject than this one, but even that movie spent too much energy on the lesbian love-making scenes, these two movies are basically the same: HIGHLY UNLIKELY AND ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE! SAME CRAP, DIFFERENT TITLE. Only people without any logic thinking ability would enjoy them. To me, both of these two movies are just a torture to watch. There are many other Korean movies all like these two suckers, so I think it's time to call off making such stupid movies.

I'm a poor guy, yet I don't hate the rich people but envy them. I'm also a certified lifetime loser but I willingly admit that most of the rich people are definitely smarter than me, there's no way I could manipulate them and con even $0.01 out of their pocket."
3.0,2020.01.02,"I don't really understand the high rate for the movie, it is very normal expected movie."
5.0,2019.09.14,"Bong Joon-Ho is a filmmaker whose work I've admired since I saw Snowpiercer (2013). I've had my eyes on him ever since and I'll watch pretty much any film he directs. His newest film Parasite (2019) is not only the best film I've seen from him so far, but it might also be the best film I've seen so far this year. He may have crafted his own masterpiece. This film is sharp, it's tight, and hooks you till the very end. It's very fast paced, it's an extremely intense edge of your seat thriller, and its comedic at times which adds some levity to the film. The performances are all excellent across the board, the script, the dialogue, and the writing are all brilliant, and the score is very intense and enthralling. And to top it all off this film is shot very well, the cinematography and directing are great, and the shot composition is very interesting. And above all else this is just a very fast paced and interesting film that was incredibly fun to watch. I can't wait to see it again, I can't praise this film enough in words. See it as soon as you can, I highly recommend it, and it might be the best film I've seen so far this year!"
3.5,2020.01.31,"This is the best Korean film of all time. Now that is not really saying much, as Korean films generally finish fourth in a competition with Chinese, Japanese and Indian films in Asia. But if this film is any indication, Korea may be on the cusp of jumping over one of their competitors in Asia. This black comedy has the feel of Coen Brothers special, though not quite as pithy or broad. There is more character development here than in most Coen films (with the exception of Fargo). Joon-Ho does a great job of writing and directing and brings his vision home to roost without any apparent flaws. Each actor in the film does a very nice job, with the daughter of the hustler family (I love good hustler films) doing an outstanding turn. I look forward to Joon-Ho's next project."
2.0,2020.04.04,"After a first screening in a theatre, I couldn't understand the hype around PARASITE. So I watched it a second time at home and once again wasn't impressed at all. I suppose it's just not my kind of flick, and as I write this review a few months later, I realize that I don't remember much of it, even after seeing it twice. I have read all the praising comments with a 10/10 note, but couldn't find any of the qualities described, as if people commented another movie."
5.0,2019.12.02,"I have seen two films previously from the director of this film, Bong Joon Ho. Those being Okja and The Host. I like them both quite a bit. I think however, that Parasite is the best film I have seen from him. Don't judge this movie on the US trailers, I felt they did a really bad job marketing the film, they made it look really pretentious. In reality, the actual movie isn't anything like that trailer. This is a dark, funny, insane, crazy, and thought provoking film.

I won't get too much into the plot as I feel it's something you should experience for yourself but the film centers around this poor family, the Kims, who try and take advantage of a rich family, the Parks. Things get complicated from there.

The acting in this movie is phenomenal, everyone here gives their A game. The directing by Bong Joon Ho is simply masterful. The screenplay is smart, creative, darkly funny like a Coen Bros movie (it reminded me a lot of Fargo especially), and is pure insanity at points. The film doesn't take sides on either family, they both do pretty bad things but at the same time, you surprisingly care about them, despite how flawed both of them are. The halfway point and the climax are some of the craziest moments I have seen all year. The movie also does a great job tackling the issues between classes in Korea.

The cinematography is beautiful, especially those big wide shots of environments. The editing is exquisite, no scene goes on for too long, they make every second of this film matter, and I never felt bored by the film, the 2 hour and 12 minute runtime flew by for me. The music is also pretty good as well.

Overall, Parasite is one film you absolutely must see this year. It has great performances, amazing direction, one of the best screenplays of the year, and it keeps you guessing what will happen next. Go into this movie as blind as you can, the less you know, the better."
5.0,2020.01.03,"Such a precise way of unfolding a story, every frame is captivating. Tells the story of social divide in a truly masterful metaphorical thriller with such craft that you can't take your eyes off any single character. Altogether a hitchcokian tale that keeps surprising you with every scene until it's inevitable and explosive third act. I'm in awe of this film."
5.0,2020.01.09,"Such a masterpiece that saved us from a big disappointment of 2019 movies, parasite is definitely the best of the year"
5.0,2019.09.22,"I might say the titel and the cover seems a bit decieving, it looks more like something for a horror movie but it totally isn't a horror movie. This film just keeps you wondering what will happen and shows a great contrast between the poor and rich. However wrong the path that main character chose, it was really creative. The plot twist were also very well done and how every part of the movie seemed to fit with each other."
5.0,2019.09.17,"A question in my mind after watching this movie is if I'm one of these roles and what will I do?

""Parasite"" presents the situation that the worst outcome might happened when the different social classes meet. The depiction of bottom-class people in this film are both sympathized but greedy. Although rich people are kind, they just can't stand the smell and life quality from bottom-class people, and they express their emotion too obviously to bottom-class people. This is humanity, and there is no correct answer, but we can think deeply in this issue. And what if you are neither parasite nor host, would you try to narrow the wealth gap or just be a bystander and do nothing?

It's very meaningful that most people give more concerns and think about each other after seeing this film."
5.0,2019.10.28,"One of the best movies of all time I would say, it's genre bending ranging from funny, suspenseful, thrilling to emotional."
,2020.01.02,"Without my habbit watching all Korean movies an airline has to offer on bord entertainment I'd probably never heard of this movie, depending how deep its run in award season gonna be and I hope it goes deep.

The movie is captivating from the first second and shows quite quickly which morbid rabbit hole it's gonna go down and depending on your own character you like it at that point or you start hating like the 1% here on imdb...

everything else already got written, not getting the Academy Award for Best Foreign Movie will be the biggest snub ever. Period."

3.0,2020.02.24,"Was expecting a great movie about social inequality. I find I usually agree with the IMDb rating. But this movie was NOT about social inequality or class status. It is about a down on their luck con artist family. Completely understandable the boy lying about going to University to get the tutor job his friend recommended him for. But morality is thrown out the window when his sister lies about the schizophrenic zone on the kids painting. Totally unnecessary and cruel to mislead a parent with mental illness fears. But then the family lies, manipulates, and scams two people to get fired. Deplorable. Do people do this cause they are poor? No, it's cause they are criminals. There are criminals at all social levels. So this is NOT some type of movie about social inequality. How disappointing.. but as a movie about scam artists it was entertaining how clever and shameless they screwed over two workers. But true to form the scam is threatened to unravel."
1.0,2020.04.03,Maybe people get too emotional in West. May be that is why it got an Oscar. There's nothing special about this movie; the story so average.

5.0,2019.10.27,"A must see if you are tired of endless Hollywood sequels and super hero movies. A can't miss if you are into Quentin Tarantino type of movies (although, without a heroic central character). This is a very entertaining story that's beautifully shot and told with many twist and turns, at a nice and tight pace, from start to finish."
5.0,2019.12.07,"This movie is just smart, entertaining, and artistically fulfilling. If it had only succeeded in one of those three aspects, this would be a very good movie, but instead it just excels at all three.

The script is more than satisfying and highly entertaining. And the way the movie presents its own world and draws you in completely... it is just beautiful.

It is difficult to judge the acting when you don't speak the language, but all interactions look very convincing and in line with the implausibility of this so ridiculous world, yet so similar to ours.

I just wanted to write this review to recommend anyone who's reading to watch this movie. I really enjoyed it and, I will gladly watch it again some time in the future."
5.0,2019.11.26,"As I write this, I want to describe my raw initial state after I finished the film, I'm in a state of complete awe, staring into the wall kind of awe, Parasite is truly a work of art, a sheer masterpiece. This film oozes with mastery, every little detail tells a story of its own, I was drawn to it like a moth to a flame, it grips hard and it never lets go, it sways between genres gracefully, it offers comedy both dark and light, drama, horror, thrill, and it's all packaged so seamlessly, conveyed to us throughout breathtaking performances across the board, I've watched my share of Korean Cinema to know that's a common thing but Parasite takes it to a whole other level, it materializes thoughts and ideas, things words can not communicate, it is extremely rare to experience such a thing in film, I can only name a small number of movies that actually made me feel this way, just incredible. Director Bong Joon Ho proves that he is a master within his own cross-genre domain, he takes charge and you actually feel like you're in safe hands watching this, he shapes the scenes perfectly, A true master of his trade, Thank You. In all honesty, I feel like I went through an experiment where the time went still and I experienced a piece of art such as this, I absloutely, wholeheartedly loved every single second of this film, MINDBLOWING."
5.0,2019.11.19,"Went in with little knowledge about this movie. This movie was hilarious, suspenseful, and horrifying. I left the theater with a huge smile on my face. Even if you don't watch foreign films, this should be your exception, because this film is something special."
,2019.10.20,"Parasite? Brilliant. You heard it here first. It's like four terrific films put into one and somehow effortlessly so. It always subverted my expectations and was a very special experience. Everyone in the theater was completely hooked by it. Laughter, screams, gasps... How many films can do that? On top of that I'm sure I'll even get more out of it on rewatches."
3.5,2020.02.24,"Parasite became the first foreign language film to win the Best Picture Oscar. The first third of the film had me wondering why.

The film opens in a dilapidated, smelly semi basement in South Korea. The Kim family is so poor that they need to borrow a neighbour's wifi and lose it when it becomes password protected. They make a living by folding cardboard pizza boxes.

Dad, Ki-taek is the weak link. He cannot even fold the boxes properly so their meagre wages are deducted. Son, Ki-woo gets a stroke of fortune, when a friend helps him get a well paid tutoring job with a fake diploma. Ki-woo tutors the daughter of of the wealthy Park family who live in a lavish mansion. Soon Ki-woo gets his sister Ki-jung a job as an art tutor for the disruptive younger son.

The wily Ki-jung conspires to get the Park's family chauffeur fired and have him replaced by their father. Before long they manoeuvre to get the housekeeper dismissed by preying on her allergy to peaches and be replaced by their mother Chung-sook.

All of them claim to be strangers to the Park family, pretty soon the Kim's are earning good money and living well. They are street smart who have taken advantage of the naivety of the wealthy Parks.

Their good fortune is threatened when one night when the Park's are away on a break, the former housekeeper returns looking for something she left behind.

I thought the movie would turn out to be similar to Joseph Losey's The Servant which was scripted by Harold Pinter. It goes in that direction but then swerves off.

When Bong Joon Ho accepted his best director Oscar he publicly thanked Martin Scorsese. It was his movies Bong studied in film school. The key is Scorsese's own British influences ranging from Ealing Films, Hitchcock to Powell & Pressburger.

There is a parasite in the Park household but the film is about class. A fatalistic, metaphorical dark comedy which morphs into a twisted blood soaked tragedy.

Parasite has a heightened reality, the Parks are wealthy who never look down even in their own house as they have no need to. They are nice but when one of them inadvertently mentions the odour of ordinary working people, like those who travel in crowded tube trains, they seal their fate.

Bong shows that those in the bottom rung of South Korean society cannot advance very far. Ki-woo has a dream but it is more likely to be dashed, fate and fortune will ensure of that."
4.0,2020.01.24,"So happy i managed to see this movie with NO IDEA what was to come, though the trailers were a strong indication of what was to come. I wish i didn't have to rely on subtitles, knowing there are many subtleties you miss with limited translation. Ater some time for reflection, this movie reminds me of 'shoplifters,' another excellent movie that reflects on unconventional familial love."
3.0,2021.07.23,"The only reason this movie got the fame and awards it got is because it is a korean movie. And let me be clear here, not just specifically korean but literally any non-US movie on par with Parasite in terms of quality would have been as successful as Parasite anyway; with a bit of luck of course. Actually not just a bit of luck; they would need all the stars in universe to align as well because that's what happened with Parasite. It is nothing but an average movie that only got this boosted because some people decided to take a look outside the rock they have been living under for over decades and they saw this average movie and thought ""That's a lot better than what I expected!"". Domino effect followed and today, we got this movie that's overrated and predictable. No different than your average ""ThRiLLeR"" movie.

P. S.: The only reason I went this hard on the movie is because the internet went so good on it and the movie got more than it deserved anyway so keep calm, the movie is still watchable; when drunk."
2.5,2020.01.04,"A story there was. Thrilling scenes there were. Some pretty cinematography yes. Solid character build-up, hell no. Logical plot, no. Entertainment, not much. Consistency of characters, missing. Petty resentful ignorance towards the rich, yes. Narrow and shallow depiction of the poor, very much.

So not convincing. Every stretch of the movie i thought I started understanding the characters a bit more, but no, next stretch would make me scratch that understanding and try to rebuild again.. In the end, it made me fail to attach with any of the characters.

Without enough entertainment, what were the film makers trying to tell the audience? I completely don't get it.

Really doesn't match the hype. Wasted two hours of my life."
5.0,2019.11.11,"Parasite Hollywood Theater 11/09/19

Disclaimer, this review is in two parts. Part One will have zero discussion of plot points and contain zero spoilers. Part Two will delve deeper into the film itself, so read part 2 only if you're cool with mild plot spoilers or have seen the film. With that out of the way:

Part One:

Parasite is no misnomer. It fully lives up to its title, as this film has taken over my brain and infiltrated my thoughts. Parasite has burrowed deep into my cerebrum and has interrupted my normal thinking capacities. I can't go a few minutes without remembering of some image, joke, line, or scene from the film. My self-diagnosis is apt and I fear I may be terminal.

I think the best way to go into this film is to go how I went, totally blind. I've been looking forward to Parasite well before it took the Palme D'Or at Canne this year. Bong Joon-ho and crew have made an absolute masterpiece. A devilishly wild, pitch-black comedy, very much domesticated and between two families. I'll leave it at that and will not dive into the plot or story. Just know this film is in Korean so it is subtitled. It loses nothing in translation but I really wish I knew how to speak Korean so I could better relate to the natural flow of dialogue.

The story is incredibly unique and builds astonishing tension that still has you holding your breath as it unfurls. Parasite pulls you in deeper and deeper, like quicksand, before too long you're in too deep. The editing is so feverish and well put together the 2 hour plus run time soars by. It feels modern, sleek, and gives me great hope for the future of filmmaking and leaves me with an even deeper respect for film made abroad.

It's worth traveling to see, with Joker in every single theater in the country it hurts my little liberal arts heart that Parasite will likely not make its way outside of larger cities. My podunk friends, I apologize, you'll have to wait for a digital or physical release, likely around the end of the year. Lucky for you ""Terminator: Dark Fate,"" and John Cena's new firehouse dog movie ""Playing with Fire,"" will keep you company while you wait.

Part Two: Where we actually talk about stuff, here be potential spoilers, ye' ave' been warnd' (sorry I am still processing The Lighthouse)

Parasite is astonishing on an emotional level. It's a spiderweb of high tension thrills, hidden identities and masterfully curated small details. We meet the Kim family. Dirt poor, living in the basement level of a towering overcrowded building. Their lives are a struggle, phones turned off, internet turned off, it's an eye-opening depiction of poverty in 2019. The entire family (mother, father and two 'twentysomething' kids) is out of legitimate work, to help make some semblance of ends meet the entire family folds frozen pizza boxes for a young entrepreneur. When a fortuitous opportunity arises for Ki-Woo (their son) to tutor the daughter of the ultra rich, affluent Park family, he finds a way to get each member of his family working for the Parks. It starts slowly, as his sister Ki-Jung acts an art therapist to young Da-Song, his father becomes Mr. Parks driver and his mother takes the place of the previous housekeeper.

Typing that all out is simple enough, but none of these people are what they say they are. And the theatrical scams put in place to get the Kim family into the house are increasingly risky and hilarious. Ki-Woo (played by Woo-sik Choi) failed his college entry exam 4 times, his sister Ki-Jung (played by So-dam Park) is a true con artist, she literally Googled art therapy and ad-libbed everything else, his mom Chung-Sook (played by an awesome Hyae Din Chang), a physically intimidating champion shot putter is absolutely not a high end housekeeper, but most fraudulent of them all is dad, Ki-taek played by regular Bong Joon-ho collaborator Song Kang-Ho. I love this man. I love this actor. I love this character. He's totally pathetic, physically weak, he seemingly has no real skills. What is evident about his character is he truly loves his family. Seeing his face light up and beam with pride when his kids commit these scams is actually heartfelt and touching.

I quickly fell in love with these characters as if they were my own family. You might get the misconception that the Park family might be rich, snobby, rude people but they really aren't. That's something I respect about Parasite, there aren't any clear cut villains or heroes. It's not that kind of story. It's so grounded in reality. Director and writer Bong Joon-ho apparently started getting this idea when he was an actual college tutor, in a luxurious house in which he didn't belong. He started thinking about how funny it would be to have his friends working in this house too.

What really grips me with Parasite is how the movie utilizes senses. It's visually stunning, the architecture of the Park mansion contrasted with the shabby half basement the Kims live in, the way light, darkness and color is used, but maybe the most impressive is how much smell comes into play. You can't smell movies, but somehow Parasite has smells. Smell becomes a large part of the film. It's hard to explain but if you've seen Parasite you'll get what I am talking about.

Bong Joon-ho has created something truly mesmerizing and thrilling. I do not have a single critique of the film. It's absolutely flawless and leaves a taste in your mouth long after viewing. I was absolutely convinced Quentin Tarantino's: ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,"" was the best film of the year but Parasite may have stolen my vote, or maybe that's exactly what the little bug in my brain wants me to say. See it as soon as possible."
5.0,2019.11.10,"This is a rollercoaster of a film,it starts off with us seeing the situation of a poor family,the friend of the family's son gives him an offer of his job and tells him to forge his graduation documents,after learning the son needs an art tutor he lies to get his sister in,I can talk about a lot of things,but the garden scene,phew what a scene. The underground husband stabs Jessica (the sister),the father attempts to save his daughter,Mr park asks for the car keys,the father tosses them and...well anyone who's seen the film knows the scene,bong joon-ho has proven he is an amazing director worthy of winning many rewards with this film alone"
4.5,2020.01.18,"This sort of reminds me of a mix between comedy and drama. I understand that parts were meant to be funny and because of the difference in culture and sub titles, lots of the humor was lost on me but I could tell that some parts were meant to be funny. It was all very interesting and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I thought this was a horror movie and it is not at all. More of a tradegy and social commentary. The smell didn't register with me either untill nearly the end but it was a great plot device."
4.5,2020.01.19,"Recommendation for this great movie. Bitter comedy, which reflects today's society, through the prism of Korea."
4.5,2020.01.15,"An incredibly complex and multifaceted film that takes the audience to a place they have never been; inside the mind of a person afflicted with an incurable mental disease: Schizophrenia. There is a legend/reality/ myth among mental health providers that one fifth of all cases of Schizophrenia is caused by a parasite from contaminated water. Rarely documented as hard scientific fact; it actually fits in quite well with the Masterful presentation of Parasite. Throughout the movie, one cannot escape the feeling of surrealism. That things don't quite seem possible to pull off and yet they do, with the help of a young man, IMHO that has has all the tell take signs of the disease: overrinflated worth, that he so desperstely desires and concocts by being selected by an acquaintance (of upper class) bypassing well trusted friends to venture into the slums of South Korea to give the young man his trust any honor across class lines to teach a wealthy girlfriend of his, despite the la c k of college training but perceived mastery in the English language through delusion, Validated by a near perfect counterfeit degree from Princeton University, verifying his talents. Similarly, his Mother as the rest of the family enslaved in Making a living through folding pizza boxes. In his fantasy, each family member assumes the role of an important support system for a family of the elite class.( In reality, would never happen, and for his entire family to be get positions and be payed well through a scheme, satisfies his fantastical delusion of wealth and success for each family member. What could be better? A symbolic rock taken ( but gifted in the mind of the actor) from the home of great distinction, must be placed in the exact location it was taken from to complete the fantasy Clues were given throughout the movie, just enough to have you scratching your head on the possibility of such an incredible sequence of events that only really made sense if it was only playing out in his mind and not reality. Paranoia slips in with the hint that the family they are scheming somehow knows their plans of taking over the house. For example his imaginary girlfriend not looking all the way under the bed where he was hiding in one seen, as he covered his eyes as to make the discovery go away because of the mental trauma associated with such humiliation and embarrassment. The Upper class father's suggestion that the panties left in his car made no sense to him, yet he blamed his driver of poor conduct and infidelity anyway, as a most revered and trusted employee. And on it goes. The young boy, who needed art therapy and special treatment was actually the son of the outcasts as a young boy, suffering a seizure in the first grade, common for Central Nervous System Parasitic infections. The final revelation occurred at the end of the movie, completing his story with a letter to his father, that he will eventually come and save him. However, earlier in the movie, their home and the entire town was destroyed by s freak flood, with contaminated water that displaced the entire community into a shelter. Yet, the basement, the glass, and the condition of the living space, filtered through low lighting, was still intact, as was he, holding on to the completed Memoir of his personal experience that was as real to him as day and night to you and I, but only rang true through his tortured thoughts from a terrible disease: Schizophrenia. The reader is encouraged to do a search of two words: parasite/ Schizophrenia, for more expanded descriptions of Schizophrenia and the legend of Parasitic causes."
5.0,2019.12.30,"This movie just changed my whole opinion about what korean movies can do! It was excellent, surprising and it is going to steak in my mind for a very long time! One of the best movies of 2019 considering that i didn't watch all of them. Also this is my first review on imdb"
,2019.09.02,"Wow. What a film. The experience of watching it is surely one to behold and one to remember. What is especially striking about the whole thing is just how well-constructed it is. A film like this, trying to do this much both narratively and thematically, could have easily fallen apart in the hands of most directors. Bong Joon-Ho is incredibly skilled in how he handles this script and his fantastic directing. Really amazing piece of work that I hope gets a ton of accolades."
3.0,2019.12.01,"The hype surrounding this film is too much, hearing people rave about it, calling it a masterpiece, movie of the year, even film of the decade. With all that praise, I expected it to be on par with films (in terms of storytelling, acting, script etc) like The Godfather, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption or Park Chan-wook's Oldboy, but no, it didn't even came close. But still it was a very entertaining movie, people only overrate it."
4.5,2020.01.18,"Like the title, the film is catchy and dramatic to the end"
3.5,2020.05.13,"Parasite is a highly polished and pretty-looking movie but it falls short in a few ways. My biggest issue was that I couldnt care less what happened to any of the characters since the parasite family are just lazy and pathetic scam artists with no redeeming qualities, and the rich family are basically clueless airheads. I really had no reason to care what happened to any of these idiots in the story. The movie also suffered from a severe case of ""tonal whiplash"", meaning the tone was all over the place. Sometimes it wanted to be hilarious like a slapstick comedy and sometimes it wanted to be taken fully seriously, like a straight drama.

Also, in the last quarter, the story pretty much ran off the rails and seemed to be dragging on and on in so many different directions that the movie lost all sense of direction and purpose. This wasnt a terrible film but its a little baffling that it is so highly praised.

The movie also has some glaring plot holes, like where did all the broken stuff on the floor go when the rich family got home? I guess if this was a silly cartoon for children that would be acceptable but not in a proper film."
2.0,2020.06.03,"In my opinion this movie is overrated. Because of the rating i watched this movie but there is not good as rating. One i like from this movie is description between rich and poor. I like this part a lot, that's why this movie got an oscar. But overall is not good as rating."
4.0,2020.01.18,"Nowadays, the horror movies seem to be just about blood, gores, and fear-inducing trite. Parasite is breaking the mold in this category as well as in the realm of Hollywood. The synopsis won't be needed as you need to see it for yourself, and for your own good. The fact that Hollywood has already adapted its plot and is currently in the works with the help of its director proves its ingenuity."
5.0,2019.10.23,"Usually I dont comment/review the movies I am watching, but this one deserves it. Dont know what to say, just a MASTERPIECE.

Advice: Dont watch the trailer or try to get any information about the movie, just go out and watch it."
4.5,2020.01.17,It was between an 8 or 9 for me and the super originality and unique story was why I gave it a 9. The only con I had was it was a pretty creepy movie throughout and I had an ending playing out in my head that I thought was going to happen and thought it would be great. I was way off course. Which is also a great pro at the same time.
5.0,2019.12.28,"This film contains everything you want in a movie. Characters who are complex - not all good or all bad, interesting homes, humor, suspense, surprise, sex and depth. I was on the edge of my seat for much of the movie. It's the best movie I've seen all year."
5.0,2019.09.07,"Wow, what a story. Real relloercoaster, you get all emotions in this movie. Korean cinematography is best by far. Hollywood needs to learn from them!"
5.0,2019.11.17,"Oh my goodness. This is one of the best films I've seen in a while. If you choose to see this film, I plead for you to go in blind. That's the best way to view it.

I'm trying to not say anything about it here. If one person sees this review and decides not to look anything up before watching, then I'll have succeeded."
3.5,2020.01.16,"I tried to watch this movie once, and faded out after the first ten minutes. It's surprising too, as the first scenes with the slacker family were very, very funny and entertaining. It reminded me of the beginning of Old Boy in a way. Upon my second viewing, I was stunned. Fully engrossed, and entertained all the way through. This is perhaps the best film of the year (I haven't seen Little Women or 1917 yet).

The story is about a slacker family who stealthy make their way into the lives of a rich family by becoming their employees. The rich family doesn't know they are related. The poor family discover a man living in the basement, who happens to be the former maids husband. Violence ensues, and the movie just becomes more detailed, fun, thrilling, and entertaining all the way through.

Usually movies tend to drop out near the end, or close to the climax. I find I usually get bored at this point. This film doesn't do that. It almost reminds me of Fight Club with its dark humor and thrills. In fact, that's the only movie that comes to mind, though they are very different films. Parasite does have its own take on class, which is very prevalent. It seems the rich and poor are very similar, with the middle class not even being presented in the movie.

Overall, this is a tremendous movie. I'm glad I gave it a second chance. Probably the best movie of the year.

7 stars"
5.0,2019.11.04,"I generally never watch foreign language movies because I'm annoyed by the subtitles. But this movie hooks you up to the screen with its visuals, the acting, the premise the shifts in the tone, you never know what's going to happen next. I don't understand Korean but still I could connect and realte to the characters. After watching Joker, I wasn't expecting any other film this year to even come near it. But this came out like an underdog! Both are 10 on 10 for me. I wish such movies are made more. I hope it gets a dub so that more people could watch it if they are not into foreign films. This is just gold and a must watch if you like shows like Fargo or even breaking bad, it has a similar aura to it.

I literally don't have any major critic for the film but if I have to nitpick, I wish the death of Kim's son was real. Because when it was implied at the beginning that he's dead, but the later on revealed that he survived, takes away the horror of that scene.

Overall, It's dark, funny, horror and sometimes feels like it's real, what if you have characters like these in your life too and you just don't know it, how many mask they wear."
3.5,2020.02.17,"When Kim Ki-woo (Choi Woo Shik) is indicated by his best friend, who will travel, as the replacement English tutor of a teenage daughter of the wealthy Park family, he is immediately hired. Soon he foresees the chance to bring his poor unambitious family to work for the family. The Kim family plots a scheme to fire the Park´s driver and the housekeeper and soon his father is hired as driver, his mother as housekeeper and his sister as arts teacher of the wealthy family. When the Park Family travels for camping, they stay in their house as if they were the owners. But soon something happens that will affect the Kim and Park families.

""Gisaengchung"", a.k.a. ""Parasite"", is an original, unconventional and overrated black comedy by the South Korean Bong Joon Ho. The film is good and the plot is funny, dramatic and suspenseful but there is no motive for the hype around this movie. My vote is seven.

Title (Brazil): ""Parasita"" (""Parasite"")"
1.0,2020.01.08,"Ludicrous movie. I can't understand the reviews. This movie is full of insane people acting completely illogical. The poor are lazy and threacharous, while the rich are naive and simple. Don't believe the hype."
5.0,2020.02.26,Good but definitely not worth an Oscar for best movie or best director.
5.0,2019.11.21,I wouldn't say anything bad about this movie because I can't!
4.5,2020.02.02,Never enjoyed and kept my eyes glued to a movie for quite some time. Enjoyably thrilling.
4.5,2020.02.09,"I love this movie! At first, I wasn't sold and then it got into this pace and doesn't slow down. Watch this movie!"
4.0,2020.02.10,"SYNOPSIS: A poor family in South Korea con their way into the home of the wealthy. They soon find themselves in the middle of a dark, unexpected secret.

REVIEW: This film is truly an original masterpiece. From Bong Joon Ho's direction to all of the phenomenal acting. So intricate and precise it left a really special film. POSITIVES: As I mentioned, the directing is absolutely superb. Bong Joon Ho really has this immersive directing style that get you to lose yourself within the film. You feel as though your living through what the characters are living through. The acting is Oscar worthy all around. Kang-ho Song, Sun-kyun Lee, Yeo-jeong Jo, Woo-sik Choi, So-dam Park and everyone else had unbelievable chemistry together. The big stand outs to me were definitely Kang-ho and Yeo-jeong. I feel those were the two captains of storytelling for their respective families and it was nothing short of amazing. Whether it was the build up for Kim Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) to what ultimate happens in the end or the absolute unwarranted trust and obliviousness of Park Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). You really get a feel of the difference in class and how a family struggles through poverty in order to make a life for themselves and how the rich use their money to mask their own ignorance. NEGATIVES: Its tough for me to come up with any negatives. This is one of those films where I don't see very much wrong at all, however, it's a film I couldn't see myself rewatching more than twice. Not that it's a bad film or too heavy subject matter, it's just not one of those films I gravitate towards for multiple viewings and that's why I don't have it as a perfect 10/10. CONCLUSION: This is one of those films I definitely encourage everyone to see at least once. It's so original and so well told that I know this is a film people will go back to and talk about the significance this film has on cinema. It will be taught in classes and will be a timeless film. Superb all around from cinematography to editing. This is a great film to get those opposed to foreign films on the boat. 8.9/10."
5.0,2020.01.29,I'm on an Oscar binge right now. And WOW this movie suprised me. Not a huge fan or foreign films and having to read a lot of the subtitles but I couldn't miss this with all the hype around it. Such a crazy thriller and a lot of funny moments with it as well. Not gonna give anything away because I feel everyone who sees this should go in it blind. By far one of the best movies of the year.
,2020.01.24,"I went into Parasite blind, I literally almost knew nothing going in and that was probably a good thing. Parasite is flat out a work of art. A lot of films can be considered brilliant or a masterpiece but this film is definitely one of them.

Parasite is one of the freshest films I've seen in ages. It's a story which is executed so well. It's a work of art and the whole film is complex, funny and somewhat terrifying at times. Both the first and second half of this film are both works of art. It is one of the best written films of the year and of the decade.

Everyone is terrifc. Kang-Ho Song and the cast are incredible. There is no faults in the performances. The cinematography is also absolutely wonderful and it's seriously well directed.

There isn't anything negative to say. It's one of the best of the year and decade. It's whatever everyone has been saying and I wouldn't mind this winning best picture."
3.5,2020.01.10,"This movie delivers everything you can expect after watching the trailer. It's an enterntaining dark comedy that has some ""drama"" and even has some tense, thrillerish moments. It won't dissapoint you, but it's not the best movie of the year, nor the best korean movie ever made. It's not even that weird or unpredictable. It's just a good movie, not an otherwordly experience. But it won't dissapoint you, you should definitely watch it."
5.0,2020.01.05,"I would describe it as a modern tragicomedy that portrays the drama of social inequality and frustration because of the excessive contrasts between social classes, narrated with black humor, paradoxes and a hint of absurdity.

It is a critique of today's society, focused on having, on the immediate gratification, on the excesses for only a few people while we close our eyes to the inequality and poverty of many.

Its well deserved, the film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes festival and the critic describes it as ""perfection made film"".

P.S. The house is a dream of architecture."
3.5,2020.06.05,Best movie of the year full of suspense and white knuckle moments is the hype. Not the reality. A unique story that misses a lot of opportunities in it's execution. A highly unsatisfying ending. Lots of loose ends. Didn't live up to the hype at all. An enjoyable watch but less suspenseful as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.
2.5,2019.10.30,"Overrated doesn't even begin to describe this film. I'm a fan of the director and am always excited when a new film of his is announced, and so it was with this film. Sadly, it does not deliver like his other works do. Performances are all uniformly excellent - particularly that of the poor family's father and the house maid of the rich family. Inventive camera work, a few chuckles here and there and a halfway point twist that makes you extremely uncomfortable and excited for where the story will go next and then...the story just takes a nose dive off of a cliff never to recover. As the film crawled towards its conclusion I couldn't wait to get out of the theater. By the time it's hoping to be ending arrives, I had already checked out. An interesting failure with a lot on its mind, but in the end, what's really underneath it all is a muddled point about class that isn't truly made. I would like for the film to have gone farther and darker than it did or to not have gone dark at all in the first place. This is a film that tries to be too many things at once and leaves you feeling cheated of seeing the movie you thought you were going to get. I keep thinking back to the one review blurb from the trailer (paraphrasing) ""a film that starts out as one thing and then becomes something entirely different"" - yeah, becomes a big stinker."
5.0,2020.02.03,"Parasite, is Bong Joon-Ho at his best, I was at first sceptical when I was about to see this movie because of all the praise it had gotten, I was afraid that the expectations that were placed on it were too high and I would come out of the film disappointed. I couldn't have been more wrong, Parasite is fantastic, it nails a lot of technical aspects such as: Cinematography,editing and its production design which is right up there as some of the best production design this year. These technical aspects however are just complimenting the excellent writing by Bong Joon-Ho who manages to flawlessly ease us from one genre of film to the next. It covers comedy, drama, horror/thriller, and also manages to dive into social themes like class systems. The way it does all of this is so subtle, it doesn't go on a rant talking about the way people act when in different classes, it shows us, which I think is a lot more powerful. It doesn't villanize any one class, both the rich and poor people in this film have their good and bad moments making it feel even more authentic. The acting is also really strong I can't put my finger on one performance as it does feel like a strong ensemble effort.

On the negative end however, some of the actions made by a character near the end of the film (Specifically the birthday party sequence), I just didn't agree that this would be something the character would do, I still found the actions performed to be entertaining, I just think this character could have made a different decision and would have as well.

Overall, Parasite is a very well directed, written and acted film, which is enhanced even further by its excellent, cinematography, production design and editing. With great performances from an excellent ensemble, Parasite is one of the greatest foreign films ever made and well and truly deserves its Oscar praise."
4.5,2020.01.22,"Well what can I say, Boong Joon-Ho is truly delivering here a masterpiece of cinema screenwriting and directing. This is an interesting, humorous and intense experience surely not to miss.

You forget this is even a Korean film as you get vacuumed into a world of it's own - you won't be disappointed!!"
5.0,2019.11.20,This is true masterpiece It's unpredictable i love this movie
4.5,2020.02.04,"Parasite is also a person who uses others to obtain advantage without doing anything in exchange . parasite is about poor family who are trying to get job in rich families home ,the son (kim ki woo ) is english tutor and his sister (ki jung ) art therapist and their parents mother (chung sook ) housekeeper and father (ki-taek) is driver . they are poor family but want to get rich so they fool park family to get this job. parasite is a success story and also winning everyone's heart ,it is also a top prize cannes film festival and best foreign film in golden globes. director bong joon ho is his seventh film and its too good . this movie told us about the ugly , brutal modern life . when someone lives out in the open and others are forced to live in shadow but everyone sucking one another's blood. this movie of director boong joon ho called it ""satirical black comedy thriller movie""so parasite is stunning movie and all characters are wonderful actors."
4.5,2020.02.08,"It's weird watching foreign films because you aren't always sure if you're watching a good performance or not. But in this film you don't have to question. The movie starts out intriguing for the first hour or so then becomes exhaustingly exhilarating. The entire last hour is a nonstop thrill ride, for lack of a better cliche."
4.0,2020.02.02,"Yep it's paranormal, Ordinary family and upper-class family how they approach the most of their points in life. Superb acting deserve a best foreign language award in Oscars 2020."
,2020.01.25,"One of my best films, rarely comes across such a fascinating work that satisfies the soul's need to receive and taste creativity and art. According to Hegel, the soul also has its needs,i think that the parasite has fulfilled it."
3.0,2025.01.29,"It took almost 6 years to decide that I wanted to see this move. I have the feeling that in the past 10 years all the movies that won the Oscar are not interesting at all and don't really deserve an opportunity, but I gave it to Parasite.

The movie is just ""okish"", it has some memorable moments, but it does not get you hooked to it all the time. Actually some parts are quite boring and you can get distracted easily.

I don't really understand how it go so much success and won the Oscar. The direction is ok, I cannot say the opposite, but performances? No way, some of them near a series B Movie performance more than a movie that had won some Oscars!!

It's definitely OVERRATED!"
4.0,2020.02.01,"'Parasite' is a South Korean family drama/black comedy, with some great acting and a unique premise. It doesn't take long to establish the characters, but does well to give us time to get to know them. It's essentially the tale of two families: the Kim's - Dad Ki-taek (Kang Ho), Mum (Hyae Jin), Son Ki-woo (Woo Shik) & Daughter Ki-jung (So Dam), and the Park's - Dad Dong-ik (Sun Kyun), Mum Yeon-kyo (Yeo Jeong), Son Da-song (Jung) & Daughter Da-hye (Ziso).

The Kim's are poor, living in the 'slums', when Ki-woo gets a job tutoring Da-hye at the Park's nice house on the other side of Seoul. Even though there's symmetry in the parents/son/daughter, this isn't an 'Us' scenario, but rather an exploration of class, social status and unconscious biases. There's no ""good guys"" or ""bad guys"" - just a semi-realistic depiction of one family seeing the greener grass on the other side and taking an unconventional approach to get there.

All of the actors are great, with a nice mix of fun and humour, with seriousness and desperation. The twist at the end of the second act is both unexpected and still poses a lot of questions - there's a few different ways it could've played out. Not quite a one-location film, but the house does serve as an extra character. Good score and cinematography. The ending is a fitting mix of bittersweet, devastating and hopeful."
3.0,2021.07.16,"Maybe I'm dumb. But given that this movies on paper is a masterpiece to me (I'm a big fan of Memories of Murder and Chaser ) but as execution, I feel like I'm fed a messege. And that broke the fourth wall for me.

The first half is masterfully plotted and acted and directed. It could have just stuck to this story and the eventual clash with the rich family. But the plot in the basement and the overall comic tone in the second half, it lost me.

It lost me even more that it's hailed as a masterpiece for Oscar. It's plain to see that Oscars have a political or some kind of Agenda. I mean over the years there has been foreign masterpieces that no one even considered in Oscars."
2.0,2020.11.09,"We live in a time where liking the eccentricities born from different cultures with a sprinkling of foreign language makes something supposedly good.

However, the moral from Hans Christian Andersen's story 'The Emperors New Clothes', is: telling ourselves something is 'good' doesn't mean it is; and, that is very much the case for Parasite.

In the main, the film isn't too bad. A poor family move in on a wealthy family and it eventually leads to tragedy. The acting is only 'alright' but certainly not fantastic as many reviewers say, and the viewer doesn't learn much about the wealthy family. The film also leaves many unanswered questions, such as:
What happened to Ki-woo's friend who went abroad, and, what did he make of it all at the end
Why did Ki-woo's father do what he did at the end
What was the point of the love interest between Da-hye and Ki-woo
It's all a little silly really

The film will appeal to:
Supposed 'film critics' (i.e. The type who claim certain wines go with certain foods) who more often than not follow the norm of other 'film critics'
The 'eccentric'
Millennial's who:
1. Wave the flag of support for anything foreign 2. Think being 'politically correct' is a political party 3. Think transgender-ism is choice not a biological state

If you haven't seen this, you're not missing much."
5.0,2020.02.08,"I tend to evaluate a film by the time it takes us to discuss about it afterwards. Parasite just premiered in Romania and we just returned home, but it's two hours since we keep on discussing it- enough to rate it with 10 stars- which happens very seldom, I must admit. I am no connoisseur of Korean films, so I am not entitled to place it here or there, nevertheless I am totally in control of my personal film hierarchy and Parasite sits high and mighty somewhere on top. Is it a satire, a comedy, a thriller, a social fresco, a mystery? It's all of them and then some. It kept me on the edge of my seat for all of its two hours. It was informative of Korean lifestyle. It was entertaining. It was gruesome. It was comic. It was satirical. It was endearing. It was never boring. Not only the actors are great in it, but the house itself deserves a place of its own in the cast. As a traveler around the world I sometimes found myself in neighbourhoods just like the ones in this film- both the favela style ones and the super rich ones. Every time I was wondering how such poverty and such richness can coexist peacefully. Not anymore, although for my peace of mind I hope not so dramatically. Parasite made me laugh, made me cringe, made me question life, gave me food for thought. What more should I expect from a film? To watch it again, clearly!"
5.0,2020.02.05,"Parasite was one of the contenders for Best Picture that I was intrigued by. I had only heard good things going in, but nothing of the actual plot points. I came out of this film needing to sit down and process the events that just occurred. Nothing had prepared me for what I just endured. Parasite is truly a different film, with semi-realistic events. Think of it as the very absentminded Ibsen for film. Every plot point in this film seems to bounce off the following event very organically and oddly very calm. Although it gets gruesome towards the finish line, Parasite is a tale of manipulation as well as a lesson in class.

The film opens to the Kim family, a very low-class family living in a semi-basement in South Korea. The family consists of Ki-Taek, the father, Chung-Sook, the mother, Ki-Woo, the son, and Ki-jeong, the daughter. They all have low paying jobs as they struggle to maintain a middle-class lifestyle. The house struggles with animal infestation, as Ki-Taek insists that the windows stay open to ensure that the dust from automobiles would get into their house, acting as a bug disenfectant. Min-hyk, Ki-Woo's friend, offers the family a relic from his grandfathers house, a stone, which symbolizes ensures future success and wealth to the family that shelters it.

On his final night in town before studying abroad, Min-hyk offers Ki-Woo his job as an English Tutor for the wealthy Park family. Ki-Woo declines due to his lack of degrees, but Min-hyk insists that he create a fake resume with help from Ki-jeong, who excels with her photoshop. Ki-Woo enters the Park's house where the interview is to be held. Yeon-gyo, The mother of the Park Family, trusts him fully as he becomes an English Tutor for Da-hye, the eldest child. On his way out, he notices a painting by the youngest child, Da-song. Ki-Woo, under the alias ""Kevin"" from Mrs. Park, refers his cousin from Illinois named Jessica, who is actually Ki-jeong. Ki-Jeong and Mrs. Park discuss Da-song's artwork and she questions if he had a traumatic experience when the child was younger. Mrs. Park accepts Ki-jeong as Da-song's art therapist.

Understanding that they could all infiltrate the Park Family, Ki-Taek comes up with a plan. One night, while exiting the house, the Park's Driver insists on taking Ki-jeong home. She leaves a piece of her clothing in the backseat of the car, in order to get him fired for sexual matter while in his workspace. The driver is soon replaced by Ki-Taek. The maid, Moon-gwang, who lived in the house many years before the Parks, has a severe allergic reaction to peaches that were planted by the Kim family. The Kim's present the evidence as Tuberculosis, ensuring the maid gets fired and replaced by Chung-Sook. The whole family, now working in the house, experience an upper-class living style. The Park Family goes away for a camping trip, leaving the whole house to Chung-Sook, who secretly invites the whole family to live there as well.

That night, a heavy downpour begins across town. As the Kim's settle in to the Park House, drinking and eating, Moon-Gwang arrives at the door and pleads to Chung-Sook to let her inside, for she claims to have forgotten an item in the basement. The remaining Kims hide while Chung-Sook goes with Moon-Gwang and helps her move a cupboard, which reveals a secret door. Moon-Gwang opens the door to reveal her husband, Geun-sae, who had been living there for four years, hiding from Loan Sharks. Moon-Gwang pleads Chung-Sook to take care of him, but she declines. The remaining Kim's fall down the stairs and accidentally break the secret that they're all family to Moon-Gwang. She threatens to tell Mr and Mrs. Park, as Chung-Sook gets a phone call from Mrs. Park, who states the family is coming home due to the rain. Ki-Taek swiftly ties Moon-Gwang and Geun-Sae up in the basement and locks them downstairs. The Kim family clean up their mess and hide as the Parks re-enter unaware of the chaos that just ensued.

As Chung-Sook cleans up from the dinner prepared for the Parks, Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong all hide under the living room table. Da-Song, saddened by the fact that his birthday camping trip was ruined, insists on sleeping outside in his tent, in the midst of the storm. Mr. and Mrs. Park watch from the couch before they both fall asleep. Ki-Taek, Ki-Woo, and Ki-Jeong successfully sneak out of the house and find their old home flooded shoulder-high. The three gather their belongings as Ki-Woo grabs the stone given to the family for good luck. The three sleep in a gym alongside their previous neighbours.

The next morning, Mrs. Park insists on repaying the debt on making Da-Song's birthday fun by creating a last-minute garden party for him. She invites Ki-Jeong, while Da-hye requests Ki-Woo to attend, for they have secretly been in love. Mrs. Park accepts and invites Ki-Taek and Chung-Sook to attend as well. As the party is about to begin, Ki-Woo opens the door to the basement, ready to kill Moon-Gwang and Geun-sae. Geun-Sae gets free and mourns Moon-Gwang who succumbed to her injuries from the fight. Geun-Sae bashes Ki-Woo in the head with the stone and runs to the party, holding a steak knife. He then stabs Ki-Jeong, as Da-Song faints, revealing that Geun-Sae was the ghost that he saw, which created his childhood trauma. As Mr. Park insists that Ki-Taek drive them to the hospital, Ki-Taek murders Mr. Park for not understanding the importance of class. Ki-Taek flees the scene, Ki-Jeong dies from her injuries, Ki-Woo wakes up from a coma a couple of weeks later, alongside Chung-Sook. A few months later, Ki-Woo is walking on a hill by the Park's residence where he sees a message using Morse Code. Ki-Woo decodes it, to reveal that Ki-Taek has trapped himself in the secret basement, going full circle from where the film began.

Parasite is a film that has no end. It is a reflection on something that could potentially happen. Bong-Joon-Ho is a revolutionary director and this could be his best film yet. Although the premise may seem a tad dull and anti-climactic (ie. the first half of the film just being about infiltration), the film never loses your interest. A great example is during the films first climactic moment, when the Park's call. The audience is sweating as you watch the father, fighting to ensure that the Parks don't find out about the truth, the children sweeping through broken glass bottles, and the mother who makes dinner. Nothing too much happening and yet, you are so intrigued. I recommend Parasite be seen by everyone.

Overall, Parasite gets a 10."
4.0,2020.01.30,"'parasite' A parasite is a living organism that receives nutrients from the host body And parasites are not good for the host body What if two parasite organisms come together in one host body? .this is what the 'Bong joon Ho' put forward to us .the main theme of film is Characteristics of Human Beings Changing their circumstances.

Reality is that after all, more than half the species on Earth are parasites, and most organisms are host to a number of them.

kim ki- taek is a poor man who lives in a basement home with 4 of his family members.the only family income is Proceeds from pizza cover making.One evening at dinner, a friend of Kim Ki-woo's (Kim Ki-woo is Ki Taek's son) came to visit ki-woo and he gifted his grandfather's a collection stone to them and forward a job opportunity to ki-woo. Ki-woo makes a fake certificate and looks forward to that job, and then he starts teaching Mr. and Mrs. Park's daughter in their home permanently. da hye fall in love with ki -woo

Mrs. Park's son da - song He is a child of disobedience but he is highly talented of drawing Ki-woo sees this as an opportunity and recommends his own sister as a drawing teacher and an art therapist, But really, she's not one of these and she also enters the house.

Kim ki - taek tells his family ""rich people are realy gullible"" The two Kims plan to dismantle Mr. Park's driver and appoint their father as the driver, and then the entire Kim family together plan to disband the hose keeper. Kim's wife comes to the house of the park's housekeeper, and they all continue to work It is here that the name of the film becomes a make sense

Kim's family life goes well in that house. One day Mr. Park's family goes on a camping trip because tomorrow is his son's birthday Kim's family gathers at Mr. Park's house that night, unbeknownst to Park Suddenly, the former house keeper gets there and changes the story of the entire course That night, everyone in the house changes their lives. If I say anything more about this movie, it will affect the enjoyment of the film.

Bong joon ho was able to make the screenplay of the film nuancly crafted Everything that comes out of this movie is interconnected, even a stone.

Kang ho song's performance as ki - taek is subtle.The acting of kang's physically and mentally embracing the mannerism of the character is commendable. The storyline, which goes on as usual, is as terrifying as it gets near the end of the story.

The director was able to intensify all the situations in the film, and he is worthy of applause. (example :Ki - taek tells to Mrs. park that your house keeper has TB. the housekeeper takes a coughing when Ki - taek and Mrs.park steps up the stairs then the camera focus toward Mrs.park's face The director edits those scenes into Slowmotion)"
5.0,2020.02.05,This was a wonderful film and I enjoyed absolutely everything about it. It's thought provoking and the story of a poor family wanting a better life isn't new but this particular concept is just amazing. I will be thinking about these people for a very long time. I can't wait to watch it all again. Loved it. Loved it. Loved it
4.5,2020.02.03,"This is the first time I can remember that a Korean-language film has been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, and it is also nominated for Academy Awards in the International Feature (former Foreign Language Film), Original Screenplay, Production Design, Editing, and Director (Bong Joon Ho) categories as well. It is already the first Korean film to win the Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival. This movie was funnier than I was expecting. Set in Seoul, it shows a poor family, the Kims, ingratiating themselves with a rich one, the Parks. The members of the rich family are actually quite decent, although somewhat condescending and gullible, and the Kims are likable rogues. The Kims, consisting of a father, mother, son, and daughter, live in a semi-basement apartment that looks out on an alley where drunks urinate. The father and mother are unemployed, the son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) has failed the entrance exam for the South Korean university system, and the daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dan) has failed to get into an art school. They fold pizza boxes for cash. When a friend (Park Seo Joon) tells Ki-woo that the Park teenage daughter Da-hye (Jung Ji-so) needs a tutor, Ki-woo applies for and, with the help of documents forged by his sister, gets the job. Then when he learns that the Park toddler son needs an art therapist for a recent traumatic event, Ki-woo recommends his sister, without disclosing that that she is his sister. (The traumatic event that the boy suffered becomes important later.) With the help of Google, she bluffs her way into obtaining the position. Then Ki-jung figures out how to get the Park family chauffeur fired, and the Kim father Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) gets the job. Using the cook/housekeeper's (Lee Jung Eun) peach allergy, they manage to get her fired as well, and the Kim mother Chung-sook (Jang Hye-jin) takes her place. By halfway through the film, the Parks are employing all four of the Kims without knowing that they are members of the same family. Complications ensue, of course, and there is a plot twist that I did not seek coming. As a social satire, this film is excellent, although the violent ending seemed incongruent with the rest of the film."
4.0,2020.02.09,"Thrilling and epic film, you wouldn't avoid feel overwhelmed of sensations watching this movie. I'm very surprised"
,2019.09.29,"My rating: A-plus. (Just like what others have already stated in this comment section: BEST WATCHED WHEN ONE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH PRIOR KNOWLEDGE OF THIS FILM:)

Starts with an unemployed Ki-woo who was asked to replace his college student friend in being a rich girl's English tutor even though he hasn't got qualifications apart from having been a repeat-taker of university entrance exams...

This one ends up becoming a thorough scrutiny of the gluttonous side of human nature which is always a welcome and an essential ingredient in any bitter satire that's in the same vein as one of those Coen Brothers' films. And this one needs to feed off the audience's unabashed derisive laughter for it to deemed a worthy yang to the yin of that J-P Jeunet classic Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain or even to a lesser extent C Nolan's Inception. Whereas the wistful rom-com and the meta sci-fi have its darker elements in the narrative neatly tucked away in its recesses, the Palme d'Or recipient does the exact opposite. Such dualism that occurs in the cinematic world is much needed which serves to cleanse each other's cinematic excesses. And it took a long time for a film like this Korean one to come by and serve as a worthy film to counterbalance the sentimentalism which can only be considered to be a magnet very much ripe for any Cy-Bugs to devour wantonly in such an orgiastic frenzy.

But the film itself can be considered as sharing the same kindredship and is way aligned more to the thematic and aesthetic sensibilities of Yorgos Lanthimos' ones (Dogtooth, The Lobster, or even the Favourite), if not quite to be considered as it's ugly, distant cocaine-junkie cousin, shares the same filmic DNA sure, though fun at parties but can be a bit of a deadweight accomplice. Whereas Boon-J-H's film is more rooted in emotional judgments that each of the characters made that has quite sensible outcomes, Lanthimos' looks like the logic that pervades throughout have just been delivered via a spaceship that endured light-years' distance flight.

Kudos to the brilliant actors and the technical crew that delivered polished work, all had their share in driving the narrative the writer/director put forth for it to become a resounding triumph. Made me laugh so hard I feel the need to re-watch it again soon. Not to give much away of the story, I will only mention one that's among my favorite scenes, that of one character's delicious rant mimicking North Korean newscasts delivered with much hysterical gusto. I can't help but fall out of my chair on that one. It is such an impressive, inspired work of an ensemble that might just beg for an American language remake because the immediacy of the issues explored might be considered to be a meaty enough for the Hollywood actors to consider sinking their teeth into, that is if the richness of the allusions that are very particular to the Korean identity and consciousness does not work against that thought."
3.0,2020.02.29,It was OK. Not sure what's the fuzz around it tho. Slow paced drama/triller with very little plot and excitment. Felt pretty boring most of the time.
4.0,2020.02.03,"Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. But this is truly a story that has many layers and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating. If you like movies with social commentary, this one is for you. It is so good, With pitch perfect performances from the entire cast and the smartest script of the year.

It is a very strong contrast after 40 minutes of the story, to see the father of the family on the same scene , trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is fine.

So when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morality of the rich and poor families. Are the rich really evil do ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them?

Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that makes us react the way we do."
3.0,2020.02.18,"I won't go into the details of the plot which can be read elsewhere but simply give me impressions. Well directed, interesting story (even if there were some clunky moments), good acting, good dialogue but way too long.

People are raving about PARASITE. I'm not one of them. Masterpiece? Hardly. All the characters are supremely unlikable. Perhaps that was intentional. Ironically, the rich family provoked more sympathy which I doubt WAS intentional. I racked my brain wondering why people are so enthralled by this movie. Do you suppose bc it has a sub text? I mean, of course it has a sub text. it is a satire on the relationship btn the rich and poor in Korea. But that is plainly obvious. It's not subtle. Actually it's not even a sub text, it IS the text. But up against Hollywood cinema which rarely has ANY sub text and usually just presents us with a story on the screen writ large PARASITE then is seen as sophisticated.

I didn't rate PARASITE very highly. That's my loss I guess."
2.5,2019.12.01,"Parasite is in my opinion a very Korean movie. What do I mean with that? Well, I will get into that late, but firstly; it was directed by Bong Joon-ho, who is best known for his English language movies ""Snowpiercer"" and ""Okja"". Both movies while being overall pretty overdramatic and simple, they at least try to have an atmosphere. They also have a clear message, which however show a very naïve perspective on reality. Even his previous Korean language movies like ""mother"" and ""the host"" are very similar in that fashion. ""Parasite"" however doesn't really show much of that regard. Neither does it have a clear message nor any sort of atmosphere, which in my opinion is very reminiscent of many of the Korean movies I have seen (with the exception of the masterpieces ""Burning"" and ""April snow""). ""Parasite"" however does have an interesting idea behind it which makes it in my opinion the most bearable of the Bong movies. But that's the only thing good about the movie however, maybe besides the production value. The movie has nice set design and has some good shots in it. It is lacking in many other departments however. The characters, for example are terribly written. They are basically shallow and in some cases only 1 dimensional exaggeration of a single character drope making the movie sometimes feeling dragging and boring, because of its focus on the characters. The soundtrack is lacking with only a few classical pieces and they are not really well placed in the movie in order to create atmosphere, often time being played behind dialog conflicting with the exposition scenes (which shows that the production value wasn't well spend in all places). The acting is decent, considering the director. Nothing bad, but also nothing extraordinary. The story consists of many plot conveniences and a lot of shock factor which ruins the whole idea behind it and makes it very confusing.

So overall I would say this movie was pretty mediocre, that's why I said its pretty Korean. It had a nice idea but doesn't do much with it and only uses it for shock value. It has very uninteresting character and sometimes feels very boring because of it. It is ultimately a very forgettable movie and the only reason I will probably remember it is because it is overhyped by many (kinda like the Korean movie ""Oldboy"")"
4.0,2020.02.02,"This is a class distinction based story full of allegory and plot twists. It's a drama, comedy, mystery all at once. Makes you question about right and wrong in a unique way. But it has also a darker side that makes you feel overwhelmed apart from the story itself. It may be the coloring of the movie."
5.0,2020.02.06,You Can't Call Yourself a Movie Maniac If you didn't Watch this Film.
5.0,2019.11.02,"I reserve 10 stars for only the cream of the crop, and I can safely say after one viewing that this was just that.

Masterfully done in every aspect. All of the acting, camerawork, and design was fitting and never over the top.

The plot was wonderfully paced and the organic tension created was very effective. Furthermore, this movie had much to say thematically and did a incredible job conveying those thematic elements while staying within itself.

I don't want to spoil even the slightest minor detail so that every viewer can enjoy this movie; as we are all only lucky enough to experience one so brilliant every five years or so. All I would advise is that you do see it, and for those of you averse to foreign films, don't let it impede you. It truly is the finest movie I've seen in recent memory. You'll forget it was in Korean."
5.0,2019.10.23,"Finally a masterpiece. It has been some time since I watched suck a brilliant movie. Put it simply, everything about it is perfect. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the score...and the amazingly beautiful end. Applauses!!"
5.0,2020.01.29,"The dark satirical thriller, directed by Bong Joon-ho, began in a very scampering fashion with the mention of the word ""metaphor"" for countless amount of time. And as you'd usually expect from a Bong film, the metaphor then played a key role throughout yhe film as the name - ""Parasite"" - suggests. Though, it depends on how you take it & what you'd like to call it because ""stairway"" remains as another option as well. How? That's the beauty of this two hour long flick. Why? Let's discuss!

And to begin with, there's the plot that on paper didn't particularly make a lot of sense as it's expected from a satire in general. But the layers beneath and the sui generis usage of the metaphor illustrated the beauty, giving the film a base to build upon. No matter how unrealistic and chaotic the occuring events were, the joyousness kept emanating throughout while keeping a lot of space for sympathy and questions in a sublime pace and lighthearted tone initially. Supported by a colourful yet limited and very important cast with a lot of depth. Each and every actors, in their respective roles, probably have outdone themselves in that regard.

On a technical note, the cinematography in particular, deserves a lot of credits. Hong Kyung-pyo managed to capture the essence of two types of Korea, something which was extremely important for the film in itself, while keeping everything so simplistic and relatable. The entire set-up of the film, that provided the innocence and realistic touch, deserves a lot of extolling. At the end, the editing acted as needle that knitted everything together. Supervised by CJ Productions (and of course, Bong) with a tight budget, it'd be totally unfair not to mention how impressed I've been by their mind-blowing piece of work.

But everything aside, what packs the ultimate punch? The theme of differences of classes and how it's showcased through the ""stairways."" Call it pessimistic as you may like, or realistic for the sake of argument, the harsh reality doesn't change. That said, do you stop dreaming? No. But sometimes you get carried away in the sea of hopes, which may be ""greed"" for many. The dependency on lower classes & prison of wealth is something the film depicts so very uniquely. And the ending eventually solidified whatever, pessimistic for some and realistic for many, Bong wanted to claim; or rather ask you. With a lot of differences of opinions on its simplistic yet so complicated ending scene, one thing remains certain - you're bound to fall in love with this masterpiece, that sure does have the potential to snatch the ""Best Picture"" award at the gala night of Academy Awards 2020!"
5.0,2019.08.25,"I don't often give a 10 but I simply have no complaints. This was an enthralling watch - even as I watched it with the subtitles! So smart. There were many angles and I'm not sure what the genre is. First the humour got me, then the characters got me, then the main plot got me, then the drama got me, the sadness got me and the horror got me. So entertaining, eyes peeled kind of stuff. You have no idea where its going to go. I found myself really rooting for the main characters and the topics are so relevant. Korean cinema - i am watching out for gems like this. Really, a clever, entertaining brilliant film. Watch it."
,2020.01.11,"This movie is rotten garbage. Main characters are unlikeable. The story as it plays out, predictably, is tedious. The characters lives are not interesting to watch. 36 minutes in I wondered if something interesting was going to happen. The movie is not funny and for sure not a thriller. The ending was ridiculous. I wasted my time watching this."
3.0,2019.10.17,"Bong Joon-Ho, the celebrated Korean director, actually won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for Parasite. His ""heroes"" at the outset are the Kim family, semi-lovable con artists led by dad Kim Ki-taek, mom Choong-sook, son Ki-woo and daughter Ki-jeong. They live in a dirty semi-basement apartment in a lower middle-class part of town where they barely get by folding pizza boxes. The fun part is that the parents view themselves more as partners in crime with their kids and encourage them to engage in any kind of unsavory activity they can get involved in.

The inciting incident involves Ki-woo's friend Min-hyuk, who informs his buddy that he's going abroad and he'll gladly give Ki-woo his job as tutor to Da-hye, the daughter in the wealthy Park family, whose father is CEO for an extremely successful tech company, provided that he can convince the Parks to take him on.

The fun begins when Ki-yoo cons Mrs. Park into believing he has impressive academic credentials after forging diplomas using some computer software. Ki-yoo goes right to work seducing the impressionable teenager Da-hye and then convinces Mrs. Park to hire his sister Ki-jeong, as an art therapist for their young hyperactive son Da-song.

Before you know it, Ki-jeong (who calls herself ""Jessica"" in the Park household) plants her panties in the one of the family cars, leading to the firing of Mr. Park's driver, who's now suspected of having a clandestine affair with a girlfriend. Jessica now introduces ""Uncle Kim"" to Mr. Park as a new potential driver; the ""uncle"" is of course Jessica's dad and he's immediately hired by the unsuspecting father.

The family has one more hurdle before gaining apparent hegemony over the Parks. Housekeeper Moon-kwang, who has been a fixture there for ages, will not be so easy to get rid of...until it's discovered she's allergic to peaches. So when Jessica applies the smallest of tinctures from a peach brew, poor Moon-kwang is felled by her allergies. When ""Uncle Kim"" convinces Mrs. Park that Moon-kwang is suffering from tuberculosis, Mrs. Park has no choice to fire the hapless housekeeper.

Parasite takes a dark turn when Moon-kwang later returns to fetch some of her belongings and soon it's revealed that her husband Geun-sae, on the lam from loan sharks, has been hiding for the past four years in the basement where there's a secret bunker (the Park home is a veritable mansion with the secret bunker doubling as a fallout shelter originally designed for protection against North Korean missiles!).

When Moon-kwang discovers the new ""hired help"" are from the same family, she records footage on her cell phone proving that they're simply a bunch of grifters and threatens to send the clip to Mrs. Park. When the Parks suddenly return early from a camping trip, the Kims scramble to confine the housekeeper and her husband down in the bunker. Choon-sook ends up pushing Moon-kwang down the stairs after she tries to escape and hits her head, suffering a concussion.

As the noted drama critic Eric Bentley once noted, farce is ""permitting the outrage without the consequences."" The Kims and the Parks can do all these crazy things without any consequences since up until this point, the story is supposed to be a farce. But once Moon-kwang is pushed down the stairs and suffers a grievous head injury, Choon-sook is no longer an amusing character.

A series of events then take us further and further away from the amusing spectacle we were enjoying minutes before. The Kims (minus Choong-sook) manage to flee the mansion after the Parks return home, only to find their apartment flooded during a storm. They're forced to sleep in a gymnasium during the night. Moon-kwang then dies from the head injury. The next day, Mrs. Park throws a birthday party for Da-song and the three Kims return.

Parasite gets more bizarre and unpleasant when Ki-yoo, wielding a rock given to him as a gift by Min-hyuk, goes down in the bunker and attempts to kill Geun-sae, who ambushes and hits him in the head with the rock. The sight of the bleeding Ki-yoo will disappoint all those who were hoping the farcical goings-on will continue.

But it gets worse. Geun-sae goes berserk and stabs Ki-jeong to death, only to be stabbed and killed by Choong-sook with a meat cleaver. Mr. Park, desperately trying to retrieve the car keys so he can take Da-song to the hospital after the child has had a seizure, gets a whiff of the dying Geun-sae, whose smell repulses him (it's been revealed earlier that Park has a revulsion to the smell of certain lower middle-class people). When Ki-taek witnesses Park's reaction to the smell, he goes berserk and stabs Park to death.

Finally, we learn that Ki-yoo survives after undergoing brain surgery. He and his mom, Choong-sook, end up getting probation while Ki-taek takes refuge in the bunker where no one finds him. Ki-yoo fantasizes of the day he'll become rich, buy the now sold Park mansion and reunite with his dad.

Some have said this is some kind of meditation on the class differences in South Korean society. Those differences are highlighted comically through most of the film but with the ensuing bloodbath, the comic tone is lost. The principals all receive their comeuppance which is good I suppose, but without the playful tone established early on, Parasite ends up feeding on the viewer, whose initial high expectations are ultimately left unmet."
5.0,2019.09.02,Korean film makers literally have such a interesting mind. Absolutely unique and a film I'll never forget!
3.0,2021.01.24,"It was pretty dang good man, I just personally thought it was a bit overrated. Maybe I'm to simple to get the major messages of the film, but hey man, check it out. This movie is a piece of film history."
2.5,2020.06.21,"I am not Korean and maybe I cannot judge every aspect of artistry in this film, beginning with the acting which was a bit shaky for me. In some scenes I saw an actor or actress pretty weak, in the next rather strong. Sometimes I had the feeling they were no professional actors at all. And I can judge acting and I know that that was not on purpose. The camera work was good, I really enjoyed the little details that were presented to my eyes, some misleading, others very clear. Would the storyline have been as thorough as that, this would be a great movie, in my opinion. But it wasn´t. None of the characters was really likeable yet all of them hat their catching moments. The dichotomy of a society, here in lower class people and the rich, worked well yet a little stereotypical. The poor were poor but witty, the rich were super rich but a little stupid or naive. Would the world be a better place if we turned reality upside down? No, it wouldnt, that´s what this film tells us. It´s a satire, of course. For a film that pretends to be on the intellectual side, the violent solution seemed like fraud rather than a well-thought script. Like some others here, I don´t know why this got an Oscar for best movie. Was this another season that was so bad that a movie like this could win?"
5.0,2019.12.06,"Just wow! Not an easy watch, that's for sure, but I LOVED every moment of it. The actors were exceptional, the directing and writing was outstanding, not to mention all the fantastic metaphors that this movie was built on. What I really liked is that there is no ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" in this story. The one you feel sorry for, later you can get really angry at, and the other that you don't like at first, you can feel for them somehow in the end - at least I did. I didn't expect a lot of things that happened in this movie and the surprises were all great. Altogether for me, this movie is like a dark but true and beautiful poem. I was in my thoughts because of it for 2 days straight, couldn't get it out of my head. I could talk about it and all the problems in life it shed a light on, for hours afterwards. Absolutely a must watch!"
5.0,2019.11.24,"This movie reminds me of Life is Beautiful in its life hacks very subtly written, amazing comedia I am sure it will win Best Foreign Picture at the Oscars And it deserves more than this Best Korean movie ever made! ----------

I went crazy when it won, it's masterpiece that will stay forever, and Bong Joon Ho will be a Korean idol"
5.0,2019.10.01,"It's hard to describe this movie, i will just say this is a critical point of view about the modern family and society. The transformation from a light comedy to a strange disturbing and a violent movie is unbelievable..... the party scene is a beautiful philosophical portrait about humans, this is truly a Powerful masterpiece."
5.0,2019.10.21,"Despite being incredibly edited and filmed. Beautiful dark cinematography. This movie takes you on a full on ride that no one is waiting for. The surprise factor and the randomness of the situations just keep adding up none stop. With a break point that leaves you with that empty feeling that something just ducked your soul and destroyed you inside but at the same time made you laugh and stay on deep silence to just digest.

Starting of by showcasing extremely complex characters you already know that you signed up for something entirely unusual. Lies and desperation can lead to absolute apocalypse. Every single scene adds to the story but it also makes it more twisted and complicated.

Do yourself a favor and watch this film."
5.0,2019.10.20,"I don't even know what to say about this movie. Just go watch it. I watched it more than a month ago and I still think about it everyday.

It has so many layers. This movie really impressed me, it was a completely different experience of what I was waiting for and I absolutely love that. It catched me off guard.

It's such a fantastic social commentary."
5.0,2019.12.23,"Original, creative, involving story.

Great acting with a crisp production.

One of the best in 2019"
3.5,2020.03.27,The movie is not what I expected. And not as brilliant as it was being told. I chhod have easily skipped this without regret.
5.0,2019.08.24,Best movie of 2019. I am in awe. In fact it's one the best movies i have ever seen in my life. What a masterpiece no wonder it won the top award at the cannes film festival. You can never guess what is going to happen next or how it will end. Damn !! Wow and it begs the question who is the victim here?
3.0,2019.12.09,"I didn't fall for the hype. The acting and visuals would be close to 9/10. They definitely made the movie. However the application of the story let it down. A lot of decisions made by the characters were just not believable. For example it is believable, very rare but has happened, that someone could hide in a secret area. But definitely not believable if they use morse code through a light every night and not get found out. Feeling downtrodden because of the way others treat or think of you is definitely believable. But stabbing someone because of this does not translate to the real world. How many people in the real world are treating a lot worse and don't stab people. And a lot of scenes were bordering on slapstick with out comedy."
1.5,2020.01.26,"After watching the movie I checked IMDB score.

There should be some kind of Korean Film Maffia or IMDB Trolls who voted with high score.

A complete nonsense.

After a hour, you start to look at the screen and say ""WHY?"".

All nonsense movies gets some award from the festival juries. I think they may wanna show off something like ""we understood the sarcasm but you don't""."
5.0,2019.11.03,"It is hard to talk about this film without spoiling it surprises, so I will basically write a love letter to Bong Joon Ho's brilliant new movie. He effortlessly builds tension, while bringing so many other elements (Slapstick! Horror!) in telling the story a poverty-stricken family climbing for higher ground on the backs of the elite. It is a moving, funny, and above all else enlightening take on how the war of the classes leaves many, many casualties. Best film of 2019."
5.0,2020.01.07,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is well casted and acted, the cinematography was very well done. The themes are thought provoking. But the greatest thing about this movie is how much love, effort and dedication went into this. This movie has every genre in it, yet it doesn't feel too cramped. It might be unrealistic and some parts but the story was so amazing. The little details in this movie is what makes it a modern day masterpiece.

Parasite is one of those movies that you will never forget and rewatch it over and over again. It is such a fine experience watching this movie, and everything is perfect about it. 10/10"
5.0,2020.02.10,"Whether you're a hardcore cinephile or a normal movie-goer, Bong-joon-ho's Parasite has got something for everyone. This genre-defying film picks up the social differences between rich and poor and mix it up with some of the best twists in the entire history of cinema."
5.0,2019.11.14,"This is something that stays with you for life. Whether good or bad, it shows it. Never have I seen a movie about classic stereotypes and used them in such a creative way that it's almost something entirely different.

Anxiety is something I'd define this movie as. It's edge of your seat, heart in your stomach and hoping. Then it happens."
4.0,2020.01.12,"Looks like a few people failed to grasp the films message. It's a more cerebral watch than their intellect can handle. Ha ha.

A dark dramatic black comedy film with a strong social commentary.

Hugely enjoyable and well deserving of its many accolades.

See it now before Hollywood tries to remake it and ruins its excellence. A fabulous director."
5.0,2020.01.11,"I'm just wowed by the film. It's an entertaining arthouse film that let audiences experience a variety of kinds of emotions during its screening. This satirical dark thriller talks about a sensitive issue about our society faced with inequality of wealth and class warfare through a poor family infiltrating into a rich household in the manner of what the audiences can easily get the point. Not only does this film provide you with such a poignant messages about the current times we live in but also it worths as a crowd-pleaser. Actually this film can't be referred as a specific genre in terms of its narrative and the plot that contain the elements of comedy, thriller and drama with the twists and turns. Bong again proves that he creates his own genre himself as just seen by many critics and cinephiles."
3.5,2021.02.06,"I enjoyed this movie, however my expectations were so much higher than it delivered based on the hype

Its good, but not top 50 good

I feel being a foreign language film gives it some level of credit with critics keen to promote something cool/exotic

Ask yourself how this film would have been received if set in US or UK and in English ? I feel it then would be just a good 7 out of 10 dark comedy / farce.

Definitely worth seeing, don't let the hype set your expectations too high and you'll enjoy it for what it is."
5.0,2020.01.12,"Yup. I've been Watching Bong-Joon-Ho's movie, And this is an end result. I won't say more. THIS IS A MASTERPIECE"
3.0,2020.04.12,"See, while the film is moderately entertaining, it is flawed. It certainly isn't a masterpiece in any regard.

The massive issue is that there is not a single sympathetic character in the entire film. Because the Kims are poor, we are supposed to forgive their unethical and often malicious ploy? The Parks are just vapid stereotypes of the wealthy. The driver is underdeveloped. The housekeeper we feel bad for at first. But she and her husband quickly become as detestable as everyone else.

So the Kims only means to finally making something of themselves is through dishonest work. All the energy and ambition they put into their scheme, they could have used to start something legitimate like their fake referral service. But their deception was always depicted as a means to a fatalistic end. Are the Park children any better for the tutelage they are receiving? No. Is the house any cleaner? The chauffeuring all that life-transforming? Naw. Perhaps if the Kims' presence in the Park household had had any positive aspect to the interaction between to the two families, the movie would have invoke some pathos at the same climax.

And the ""wealth rock"" symbolism. Got it. If they were so smart, they would realize simple living within your means is the key to contentment. So, yay, never hold your metaphor - as the writing rule goes.

And the climactic punishment is not nearly sufficient. For the Kims, it's one dead, two on probation and one ""scot-free"" after racking up a host of crimes including one triple homicide - only a third of which was of a different socioeconomic class. That is some good karma for railing against the rich and being utterly deplorable schemers but mostly killing their own kind. Yeah, yeah, the dad gets trapped under the house. How was this proper retribution? He was never the mastermind; his rotten kids were. And mainly, it was the son, who is the agent of everything. Without his friend, without him receiving the stone, without his foot in the Parks' door, there is no movie. The daughter gets what she deserved. But he gets ""lesson learned (maybe)"". And Mrs Kim is just along for the ride? A big fat no to that.

I also found it hard to believe that the source of those flickering stairwell lights would not have been investigated by the fastidiously rich residents with their impeccably stocked wine fridge - especially with Neurotic Helicopter Mom no. 1 always home.

I already was well-aware of the rich-stay-rich-and-poor-stay-poor cycle that was supposed to be the revelatory theme of this movie so it was not nearly as impactful. And with the characterization and outcome flaws, the film was okay but not nearly as evocative as it could have been. I really wanted to see some arc movement to any of the characters, even if ever so slight before the same ending. But they all start out and stay one dimensional. And it takes a bloodbath at a child's birthday party to get a couple of them to say, ""aw shucks, maybe this wasn't a great plan"". And then the final point of the movie, per the director himself, is to just accept your impoverished state because even years of honest work will not get your murderous father literally out from under the rich that you caused to begin with by seeking to be like them. ""The whole notion of ""why bother"" makes no sense or point thematically in art."
0.5,2019.08.30,"This had the makings of a fun farce. As I watched the first hour or so, I thought it could be a madcap Hollywood comedy. Implausible, yes, but amusing in an absurd way.

But then it started to go in weird places. Some will call it social satire, but to me it was just dark, amoral and incoherent.

The protagonists (the family of scammers) are profoundly unsympathetic. They wreck the lives of everyone they come into contact with, and some of their victims are just fellow struggling domestic workers. Yet the film-maker seems to see them as the downtrodden heroes of the film!

Their story also makes no sense. When we meet them, they are solvenly, helpless, inept and unemployed. In the opening scenes, they are scolded for doing a simple job badly-assembling pizza boxes. But then suddenly they become master con artists, taking over all aspects of the lives and household of a wealthy family, running everything with efficiency and aplomb. This is just bad writing, not a masterpiece.

While their employers were absurdly naive, I didn't hate them as much as the director seemed to want me to. Yes, they are silly, but they are also hardworking and accomplished, they love their kids, and in almost every way, they are morally superior to the people preying upon them. In the director's upside-down world view, their wealth and comfort makes them deserving of whatever happens to them. The fates of the employers and their original employees don't seem consistent with any sort of moral compass.

Without spoilers, all I can say is that the climax and ending of the movie are unsupported by what precedes them, not just in a moral sense but also in terms of the characters' previous behavior. If the writer of this film had expressed the message of the film as a simple essay, unadorned with acting and cinematography, it would be dismissed as a childish and unintelligent mess.

I would not recommend this so-called masterpiece, though I do think a other director with a lighter touch could remake it into something more coherent."
5.0,2020.01.13,"Great work! from start to end, it is wickedly funny and darkly disturbing all at the same time. The narrative and the actors were excellent. One of the better endings of a movie, The most original film and one of the 10 best films of 2019."
5.0,2020.01.13,"You may not like everything you see, but you will be moved. I can't add much to the many excellent reviews here except to say that this is a film for true film lovers, not movie-goers. It's a film that makes you laugh, cry and most of all, think. Do not try to interpret the plot literally. The story is metaphoric. Zen, not Hollywood."
5.0,2019.11.11,"I didn't think I could have my expectations exceeded for this movie, but WOW! Bong Joon Ho really floored me with this one, I tell you what!"
5.0,2020.01.16,"Quick. Metaphorical. Social. Postmodern. Beautiful.

You miss if you don't watch it."
5.0,2019.11.18,"From the beautiful cinematography, blocking, locations to the fantastic acting and screen play it is a must watch movie. This truly original story was a once in a lifetime journey that had me laughing, crying and frighten all in one sitting. Don't take my word for it see it for yourself!"
4.5,2020.01.12,"There I said it---It's the best film of the year for this reviewer, and it's the best film Bong Jong-ho has made to date.

But to be fair, I've yet to see ""The Irishman,"" ""1917,"" and ""A Hidden Life,"" so my opinion could change. Though, I can't see that being likely.

The originalness of ""Parasite"" is what sets it apart. ""Parasite,"" twists and turns to darker and darker places while still maintaining a comedic tone. There's ingenious visual cinematography and storytelling when it portrays the division of class between the wealthy and poor.

Class inequality is a theme director Bong Joon-ho frequently uses. You observe it in his other films, ""Snowpiercer,"" ""Okja,"" and even in the first film I ever saw of his back in 2006 with Joon-ho's horror film, ""The Host."" Which also starred Kang-ho Song who plays, Kevin's father in ""Parasite."" He's hilariously witty in both films.

""Parasite"" set in South Korea, is about a young man from an impoverished family, the Kims, who winds up with a job to tutor a high school girl from an extremely affluent family, the Parks. He changes his name from Kim Ki-woo to Kevin to impersonate an English tutor. He soon realizes this could be a way to get his whole family employment under the Parks, and the family makes it their plan to do-so.

The film shined when it cinematically showed the differences between class equality among these two very different families. When we see the wealthy Park family, the house is pristinely clean. A complete contrast to the Kim family apartment, which is a basement apartment littered with trash and infested by stink bugs, in what looks to be one of the poorest sections of the city.

If you like dark comedies, then you're sure to enjoy ""Parasite."" I've witnessed people who don't like foreign films because of subtitle-hatred still relish this film.

You won't see another movie like ""Parasite,"" perhaps ever. Well done, Bong Joon-ho."
3.5,2024.05.27,"""Parasite,"" directed by Bong Joon-ho, is a masterful blend of dark comedy, social commentary, and thrilling drama. The film follows the impoverished Kim family as they con their way into working for the wealthy Park family, leading to unexpected and shocking consequences.

The film's greatest strength lies in its storytelling. Bong Joon-ho skillfully balances humor and tension, keeping the audience engaged and on edge throughout. The screenplay is sharp and layered, offering biting commentary on class disparity and social inequality without being preachy.

The performances are stellar across the board. Song Kang-ho, as the Kim family patriarch, delivers a nuanced performance, while the rest of the cast, including Choi Woo-shik and Park So-dam, bring depth and authenticity to their roles.

Visually, ""Parasite"" is stunning, with meticulous attention to detail in its production design. The contrast between the Kims' cramped basement home and the Parks' luxurious mansion is striking and symbolic.

However, some viewers might find the film's tonal shifts jarring, and its ending, while impactful, may not satisfy everyone. Despite these minor issues, ""Parasite"" is a thought-provoking and well-crafted film that leaves a lasting impression. It's a unique cinematic experience that challenges and entertains in equal measure."
5.0,2020.01.24,I find the film's visual symphonic. The use of montage in such a way that creates a flow of revelations. Camera movements are buttery smooth and well executed. The concept of the film which is about the social classes has paid such an impact to the audience. Bong joon-ho used such a technique in which he showed us the things that we may not be aware of. The film did a great job on putting its audience on a thrilling rollercoaster ride of emotions.
3.0,2021.01.14,"What's funny is that the parasites in Hollywood loved this film because they actually sided with the scumbag poor family.

When the point of the film is that they get biblically punished by a flood for acting like demons. That scene where she's smoking a cigarette on the toilet is powerful.

Although, much like Hitchcock taking it one twist too far at the very end of Vertigo, the poor dad killing the rich dad at the end felt totally undeserved. It wasn't built up to properly. It felt like the director just wanted to get to that point but the pieces weren't placed to justify it, for the audience or the character.

If your DAUGHTER just got murdered by a fellow poor person why would your immediate reaction be to empathize with the plight of the DAUGHTER KILLER as inspiration for killing the rich guy COMPLETELY OUT OF LEFT FIELD. Sure the rich guy called him smelly and sure he was resentful towards him, but to murder him in front of everyone just read as extremely false and dumb.

I don't believe actual poor people would even like or empathize with this ending. This is purely a trashy parasitical rich person's fantasy.

It's a shame the ending was so stupid because up until then it was a pretty darn good flick."
1.0,2020.11.10,I really don't understand how this has such high ratings. I really tried to like it but fell asleep less than halfway through.
4.5,2020.01.12,"This is undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year and I think the best work of Bong Joon Ho yet. It's a very funny and playful movie. You can't pin it down into one specific genre, much like Bong Joon Ho's other work. Some moments are absurdly funny while others are intense. The premise is about a poor family who lives in a small basement apartment and struggling in their everyday life. One day one of their family members gets a chance to work as an English tutor for the daughter of a wealthy family. The poor family sees this as an opportunity to scam this wealthy family and they find a way to all work for them. Things get more serious after the first half because some stuff happens and the poor family has to deal with it cautiously. What is amazing about this movie is the story is simple and realistic, but told in such a fresh and unique way that it feels relatable and larger than life. The director shows the irony of life. How two separate classes of people in a society perceive things differently. While watching the movie, it was so engaging that I felt like it was controlling me with its beautiful cinematography and well structured plot."
4.5,2020.01.16,"My first ever Korean film and the film lives to its expectation after seeing the movie trailer. It was mixed of comedy, suspense and even horror, go see it you'll be suprised!"
5.0,2020.01.20,This movie had it all. The premise was so strange and unique. I never knew what was going to happen next. It touched on important issues around class and family. Overall just excellent. One of the few movies that deserves 10 stars
5.0,2019.12.02,"Rather than review, I like to add two cents to the conversations.

One individual comments that she never rides the subway. What is the significance of the below ground/above the surface boundary? Which domain affords the better social perspective?

And is anyone in this story not parasitic? Hardly anyone that I can identify."
4.5,2020.01.22,"Hilarious at times, weird, with some unexpected plot twists. Shows that whether you are rich or poor, the life you lead is really is just as futile........update: Yessss I am so happy that it has now won an oscar for best movie ! Well deserved!"
4.5,2020.02.09,"Director Bong Joon-ho's global sensation, Parasite, is an allegorical tale of class warfare. Before watching the film, I was familiar with its high praise but knew little of its actual plot. If possible, I'd recommend other viewers similarly go into this one as cold as they can. While Parasite deals with heavy themes (economic mobility, climate change), it does so in ways that are constantly entertaining and surprising. A unique blend of drama, suspense, comedy, and horror, Parasite provides further proof that cinema is a truly universal language."
3.5,2023.11.09,"Parasite stands as a cinematic tour de force, a film that transcends genres and defies easy categorization. Bong Joon-ho's directorial brilliance is on full display in this Korean masterpiece, a compelling and thought-provoking exploration of class divisions that seamlessly weaves together dark humor, suspense, and social commentary.

From the opening scenes, it captivates with its meticulous attention to detail and visual storytelling. The cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo is nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the stark contrast between the cramped living conditions of the Kim family and the opulent luxury of the Park residence. Each frame is a visual feast, contributing to the film's immersive experience.

The narrative unfolds with a gripping precision, as the Kim family, struggling in the lower echelons of society, cunningly infiltrates the lives of the wealthy Park family. The plot twists and turns with a surprising and relentless momentum, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. Bong Joon-ho's screenplay is a work of art, seamlessly blending elements of comedy, drama, and thriller into a cohesive and engaging story.

Central to the film's success are the stellar performances from the cast. Song Kang-ho leads with a nuanced portrayal of the patriarch, Kim Ki-taek, navigating the complexities of his character with finesse. The entire ensemble, including Choi Woo-shik, Park So-dam, and Lee Sun-kyun, deliver performances that breathe life into their multifaceted roles, creating a palpable on-screen chemistry.

The movie is more than just a suspenseful thriller; it's a profound commentary on societal inequality. Bong Joon-ho skillfully uses the Kim family's strategic infiltration of the Park household as a lens through which to examine the stark contrasts between the haves and the have-nots. The film prompts viewers to reflect on the systemic issues of class disparity and the lengths individuals may go to escape the constraints of poverty.

Beyond its social commentary, it also explores the universality of human desires and the consequences of unchecked ambition. The characters, while navigating their respective socio-economic challenges, grapple with themes of morality, identity, and the pursuit of a better life.

In conclusion, this is a cinematic triumph, a film that not only entertains but also challenges and provokes thought. Bong Joon-ho's masterful direction, coupled with outstanding performances and a richly layered narrative, makes it a standout in contemporary cinema. This Korean gem deserves every accolade it has received, marking a pivotal moment in the global recognition of the richness and depth of Korean filmmaking."
4.5,2020.01.17,Apart from the great cinematography what overwhelmed me about this movie is its screenplay. The movie follows a continuity of speed and all the way keeps the humour intact. The dark satirical comedy which is funny but after every laugh it also pins a thought about the actual darkness which creates the humour and it lingers for sometime. A movie for all genre lovers.
3.0,2020.09.13,"The Kims are a struggling lower class family. One day the son gets an opportunity from a friend. He also gets some good-luck rock from him that will lay a role later in the film. He can work as an English tutor for a rich family. His sister forges a bunch of documents for him so he appears US educated. He gets the job and starts a relationship with the his tutee. The rich family lives in an amazing mansion built by some famous architect. The wife is naive and lives in materialism. The father, a famous arrogant musician, isn't home much but there he is worshiped. They also have a young son who is trouble, as all kids that age. But the mother acts overwhelmed and thinks he's some kind of painter prodigy. That gives the tutor a chance to get his sister hired as an ""art therapist"" for the troubled son. So the sister impersonates an art therapist. When she's meets the chauffeur she devises a way to get him fired and her dad hired instead.

Now they all figure out a way to get rid of the housekeeper. They succeed. When the Parks leave for a weekend, the Kims celebrate in the mansion. Then the former housekeeper shows up. She reveals that there is a secret basement where she's been keeping her husband and begs mother Kim to take care of him in exchange for money. Then the entire Kim family falls literally to the ground in front of the housekeeper and this the entire scam is revealed to her. She takes some video. The families fight over the video. Then mother Park calls announcing that they will return home soon. The Kims hide under the living room table. The old housekeeper fell down the basement stairs and is seriously injured. Her husband is bound back in his basement room.

Eventually the Kims escape as the Parks actually decide to sleep in the living room. There's heavy rain and their humble basement home has been flooded. Then they get a call from the Parks to help them for a birthday party for the son next day. In the middle of the party, the housekeeper's husband has freed himself. and takes his revenge by smashing son Kim's head in with his good luck rock, then attacks daughter Kim with a knife. Father Park has repeatedly complained about the smell of the Kims. That leads father Kim to attack Park after he's taken care of the housekeeper's husband.

Parasite is a horror comedy of sorts that shows the stark contrast between the poor working/scheming family and the wealthy/naive family whose ""problems"" are mostly blown up minor issues. The characters are slightly cartoonish. Things are somewhat enjoyable for 2/3rds of the movie. You do end up rooting for the Kims. The bizarre and unlikely appearance of the housekeeper and her husband change the tone of the movie and for the worse. It also disrupts the movie too much and it doesn't recover. From then on you know and expect something you happen, you just don't know from which direction it will come. In the end it's somewhat of a surprise but it doesn't amount to much really.

Sure, economic class is an issue here but the story is covered in satire and humor, no doubt to make a serious issue more palatable, thus diluting whatever serious issue is being addressed. It's not so much about class warfare but rather codependency. As with any codependent relationship, there are pet peeves and unaddressed grievances and resentments. But there is no major message in the movie. It could have don't more with the theme but it went for an easy solution, one that doesn't solve anything."
1.5,2020.06.22,"I'm really amazed under which category this film lies. Comedy? It is not funny at all. Tragedy ? I don't know!!! Four Oscars and Palm d'or !!!! Are you serious. I can't say that I know better than the people who awarded the film these prizes, I'm sure the problem is me, there is something hidden deep in this movie I couldn't see."
5.0,2020.01.16,"Delightful from beginning to end, opening is way in between genres, loved the pace, the comedy, the ending, the twist, the characters, pretty much everything.

I'm just waiting to rewatch it and pick new details.

if you do (watch it) please do it in the cinema and maybe you will get a crowd like mine that bonded trough the laughs and the shock and ended up talking about it outside.

And If you end up thinking is overrated it's okey, but you will still end up thinking about it for days."
5.0,2020.01.13,"In our current era of film, it is commonplace to take a moral stance. Whether that stance is on human struggles, political processes, or social conditioning, the stance prevails, and we as the audience have to make our decision while we watch the film on whether or not we agree with the points being brought to us. Films like Elysium, Little Women, 1917, these all wear their moral stance on their sleeve.

Parasite does it differently. The film opens in a way that makes you think the morality of the film will be open and obvious for you, so that you don't have to think too hard about the minutia to feel confident in your morals while watching it. You think you know who to root for, and who is the ""bad guy"".

As you keep watching, Parasite continually pushes your sense of morals, prodding you with the question ""how far is too far?"" and ""how bad is too bad?"". These questions never give you a break, never give you time to come to terms with your answer as Bong Joon Ho continually ramps up the tension until you feel as though your heart will stop in it's tracks.

Parasite poses a moral stance with great nuance and care."
5.0,2020.01.20,"Nothing comes close. In terms of direction, writing and performances."
5.0,2019.11.09,"PARASITE Directed by Bong Joon-Ho How often does one get the opportunity to see a film, on the silver screen, which leaves you enriched by the immaculate craft of the filmmaker's original voice and style of storytelling? How often does a movie leave you inspired to just grab a stack of paper and a pen, and begin writing your very own story? Bong Joon-Ho's Parasite is definitely one of those movies which left me moved and inspired. It's one of those movies which beautifully broadened my view towards the world. This film tackles social issues in a visually visceral and cinematic manner; it doesn't rely on preachy monologues and melodramatic action to convey its underlying themes of class discrimination, greed, family, and morality. Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, craft the screenplay in a subtle style in order to convey the social issues that are revolving around the film. Parasite tells the story of the Kim family, which is made of four individuals: a father, a mother, a teenage boy, and a teenage girl. This family takes interest in the Park family, who are incredibly rich and wealthy, when the teenage boy, played exceptionally by Choi Woo-shik, takes over his friend's job as an English tutor for the daughter of the Park family, who is a sophomore in high school. The film proceeds with the Kim family obtaining the various jobs around the house of the Park family, who are unaware of this. From there one, Bong Joon-Ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, tell a beautiful story of family, class discrimination, empathy, and morality in a satirical and dark manner. Parasite embodies a countless number of flawless moments of storytelling, which can leave one entertained, thrilled, and moved. Bong Joon-Ho utilizes visual storytelling to not only heighten the thrills, but using minute details to depict the discriminations that are made between the rich and the poor. There are two scenes which depict the way the rich and the poor perceive heavy rainfalls. The Park family are enamored by the sight and scenery of the rain from their window. Whereas the Kim family, struggle to grab their personal belongings due to their basement apartment being flooded by the rainfall. Yang Jin-mo's editing immerses the viewer in these visually engaging scenes. There is one moment where she uses the shot of the overflowing water transitioning to a bird-eye shot of the Kim family and their neighbors struggling to take the water out of their homes by using buckets. This is what makes Parasite shine as this visual experience, where we as an audience, understand both sides of the coin. The audience is able to grasp a sense of the struggles that the poor have to face, and this is done with incredible cinematography by Hong Kyung-pyo. The performances of Parasite are incredible. Each actor provides a nuanced and authentic performance; they faithfully portray the psychology of their characters. Another incredibly refreshing aspect of this film was how Bong Joon-ho and his writer, Han Jin-won, portray the Park family. They aren't portrayed as stingy rich people, they are kind, caring, and naïve. They are naïve to the point where they are baffled by the smell of a poor individual. Bong Joon-ho authentically depicts the humanity of both the wealthy and impoverished characters of the film. The way the characters are crafted and portrayed is what allows the film to augment Bong Joon-ho's original voice as a storyteller. Parasite is not only the best film I have seen this year; it is the best film I have seen this decade. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for crafting a tour de force of a film. Thank you for reassuring me, as an aspiring storyteller, that stories build bridges of unity. Thank you of inspiring me to write a story that is original and deeply resonates with my memory and my heart. As the great Japanese filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa once said, ""If you genuinely want to make movies, start writing screenplays. Take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write, write, and write."" Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece, Parasite, inspired me to go home and take a lot of paper and a pen, and just write the stories I want to tell. Thank you, Bong Joon-ho for shrewdly crafting a masterpiece that beautifully depicts the themes of class discrimination and filiality."
4.5,2020.01.20,"As many other reviewers have mentioned, Parasite is a masterpiece that deserves a second viewing. There are many subtle lines and actions that piece the film together towards the end.Take for example ""Crossing the line"" - the rich dad keeps bringing it up. He wants his staff to know their place. That family and their staff are like a micro version of society with its different castes.

Sure, it was easy, yet deceiving, to infiltrate their household so cunningly, but once they settled in they realized just how different they were from the upper-class folks they were serving. Even the son who tutors the daughter comes to realize that he doesn't fit in despite the daughter's fondness for him, she might even be in love with him (or she's just infatuated).

The basement represents the slums in which they reside like cockroaches. The upper-class family lives in an incredible house high up in what I presume is Seoul. When their home gets flooded they lose everything whereas the rich folks are not bothered at all.

The party represents a climactic finish where all the confusion, frustration and anger surfaces in a final act of despair. The poor dad knows he will never be equal to the man he chauffeurs around. In fact, the very man he drives around is disgusted by him.

This is a great movie that touches on many subjects. I highly recommend it."
5.0,2019.11.27,"Ranks as one of the best films I have ever seen and I've seen many .

Very clever , unusual story it's about as original as a film can be , it totally lacked the predictability of most US films.

Don't miss it"
3.5,2019.12.07,Absolute cinema perfection.This film is an emotional rollercoaster as a whole. It makes you connect with the characters and makes you hope but after a minute crushes your hopes and then makes you rebuild it..
5.0,2020.01.12,"Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great acting, wonderfully written screenplay, artist style and cinematography. Too much to talk about, just WATCH this movie."
3.0,2020.04.20,"This film started well and I liked the opening dialog and the concept, but this film is simply not worthy of a Best Picture Oscar. There were too many disjointed scenes and bad editing. I think I need to see some more of this directors other films. I watched Okja and thought it was poor, so not sure what all the hype is about. 6/10 No doubt it will be remade Hollywood stylie but I wont be bothering to see it."
0.5,2019.11.22,"A family of incompetents who struggle to fold a pizza carton miraculously transform to ingenious con artists and infiltrate themselves into a rich home where they successfully pretend to deliver services they have no clue of. The inhabitants of the house, on the other hand, are so incredibly stupid that they don't notice anything is wrong except for some wierd smell. But the impostors refuse to be judged by their smell! A bloodbath follows. The end. Standing ovation at Cannes, Palme d'Or, 8,6-star rating on IMDB... It's not just a bad story, no, it's actually the perfect story based on the wrong belief that if you are poor, you cannot be expected to be good, and if you are rich, you are never good enough. Naturally, stereotypical characters follow and I couldn't make myself care about any of them. The only moments when the poor father showed some deepness were during his monologue about living with no plans and when he checked his smell after he heard the rich father complaining about it. Otherwise, all family members were interested only in filling their bellies with junk and had no reservations in causing any kind of harm to that end. Now, I know I'm supposed to dislike the rich family, but although I didn't like them either, I don't see what's so wrong about them. But the urge in society to favor the have-nots, no matter what their actual traits might be, is so strong that most of the reviewers take their side, while some even find them ""lovable"". And that I find even more disgusting than actually being disgusting.

Post Oscars Addition: Technically Parasite is a great movie, no, really. But the Oscars are not about that. Nor it is why anybody watches movies. People are interested in stories and these awards are all about politics. Now, the fact that this movie won most of the major Oscars is not that surprising. Could be because it is a foreign movie, could be because it is a marxist movie, could be both, as far as they are both valid arguments for leftist Hollywood. What concerns me is that it looks like the whole world is praising it happening and I'm sure that most fans don't care about the art of storytelling or directing. I think they believe what Bong Joon-ho ultimately shows us: that nobody is deserving, that we are all a bunch of idiots, clashing in a stupid game for money. But think about that: someone did build the house where we all want to live in, right? And that must be someone with some knowledge, skills, and integrity, otherwise the roof would have collapsed, wouldn't it? Does everybody really find it fair to deny all this?"
4.0,2020.01.14,"Great! Awesome! Very interesting plot! I think it is one of the best thriller of 2019! I'm not a fan of Korean films, but this is great movie! I hope it win one or few Oscars!"
5.0,2019.11.23,"The best film of the year, maybe the best film of the decade. Just one of the best films in general. Joon-ho Bong balances a social thriller, satire and drama, perfectly and effortlessly. The cinematography is as good as I've ever seen in a film; the editing keeps it highly engaging; the production design adds the impactful disparity between the classes; the score and sound design adds significant character and emotion to each scene; and the performances are powerfully executed from the whole cast. Parasite deserves all the high praise it is receiving from critics and somehow, it deserves more."
5.0,2019.11.26,"I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and it's sticking with me.

I can't give a solid review yet because I'm still processing everything. Not so much processing but there are so many layers to this movie from rich to poor to cons to subtleties that the average movie-goers might miss.

This is a must see and I truly hope it wins Best Foreign Film this year if not Best Picture.

What a film."
5.0,2020.01.16,"One of the best film in foreign language !!! Actually it's not a film, It's our real life story... I have nothing more to say about this great creation....."
5.0,2020.01.12,"One of the best films of the decade. It has it all: amazing cast, great music, cinematography, genius writing and direction. And most important, it's thought provoking. A philosophical piece about where moral stands in life of survival, about the ascend to happiness and the descend that reminds you money isn't everything. The characters so complex yet so simple and delivered with brilliant acting. Bong joon-ho has proven to be one of the best filmmakers working today."
5.0,2020.01.13,"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..

I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.

As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year.

The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining. Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.

Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.

Grade- A+

Brody's TAKE 5"
3.0,2022.01.02,"This film is an ok film. It has some funny moments, some agony moments and a little drama. I can't say I had a hard time watching it. But I really can't understand how people lost their minds. The poor family with all these lies get a very nice job with good money. Yet they still don't move out from the basement, they decide to continue living in there and not moving out to start living a better life. They even throw a party to the mansion and thinking how they can take more from the rich. So am I supposed to feel sorry for them at the end? The movie doesn't imply that the rich family are greedy or they stole money from others for themselves. Mr Park seem to working pretty hard to be in that position and to earn his money. They pay well the working staff and even extra is some occasions. Of course they seem to be discussed by the poor but they don't offend them in any way throughout the film. So to me they are more ""likeable"" than the poor family. Overall is a good movie but that's it. I literally don't understand the hype."
5.0,2020.01.11,"I absolutely loved this film. I thought it was sad, darkly funny, discomfiting, and absolutely brilliant. It's hard to talk about the script and its astute observations about class and equality without giving too much away, but oh my, so many stairways so leaden with meaning. If you aren't into foreign movies because of the subtitles, I'd still highly recommend seeing this. He is such a master of image and setting that it conveys as much as the dialogue. I've got ""Snowpiercer"" lined up to watch tomorrow for a full-on Bong Joon-ho weekend."
,2020.04.02,"The fourth movie I watched from the director. Gwoemul is still in the best movies I've watched. Although the subject of the movie in general was ordinary, it was fun to watch half the movie, other half bothered a little. I like it even though it can't give the effect I expected at the end. Acting and script were nice. Social messages were sufficient again. I like the movie but Gwoemul still best for me!"
3.0,2020.02.14,"Well, I can't understand how this film defeated The Joker and 1917 at the Oscars.

Nice movie, yes, but not spectacular.

A lot of plot shortcuts, as if the poor family were world class con artists. So illogical."
0.5,2020.01.05,"I can't believe that this movie is being called a masterpiece, it was ok at best. To me it feels like the director wanted to represent the feelings of the lower class population towards the rich but he failed miserably because its potrayal of both the rich and the poor is so illogical, I honestly felt like I was watching an adaptation of a bad fanfic. I think only people who are easily impressed would enjoy this movie."
5.0,2020.01.14,"This year the Academy Awards have gone even more nonsensical than usual. Not only did they unjusitfiably snub many deserving people and movies, but over-ladened a few films with much more recognition than they deserve.

Once Upon A Time in Hollywood - 10 Oscar noms. (why?) Joker - 11 Oscar noms. (why?)

Parasite? 6. (all deserved).

Basically, the Oscars are more of a joke with each passing year. However in saying that, at least they gave 6 nominations to Parasite, which in my opinion is the clear frontrunner for Best Film.

It's the most interesting and engaging movie of the year, and the most successful Korean movie in history, both in Korea and around the world. I highly recommend it."
5.0,2019.12.25,"I don't know whether if it's just me but each member of the ""parasitic"" family reminded me of some or other person that we would have met in our lives and even to ourselves. It is one of those movies that has brilliantly captured human greed and class discrimination on-screen. The film starts out portraying the Kim family, their love for each other amidst all the poverty and difficulties and their omnipresent desire to grow rich. A ""lucky stone"" introduced in the beginning and running throughout the plot probables resonates with a classic human trait, clinging to the narrator throughout the plot. The all-too-powerful plot throws up some brilliant twists that could never have been guessed upon. One of them leading to the protogonists' running away from the affluent Park's home after an eventful night. This scene is potrayed too realistic that it produces a sense of helplessness in the viewers. This juncture in the movie was too overwhelming for me- the brilliant but subtle portrayal of the darkness clouding into their lives and the classic reminder of ""actions gone too far"" makes you feel for them. The transformation that the narrator's father undergoes after this night and his subsequent actions is a powerful blow to the socio- economic casteism that is present in our world. A brilliant masterpiece that deserves to be watched and felt upon!!"
4.5,2019.10.31,"I predict a strong hard campaign to make this South Korean movie become a hype until to get its deserved Oscar. The allegory is pretty awesome. I recommend to get a blindly watch, because this could be very useful. I'm gonna pay attention more on next Joon-ho Bong's projects."
5.0,2019.12.04,"There are no flaws. It has transcended film itself. It's funny, scary, sad, and gripping from start to finish. As one critic put it, ""It's a magic trick.""

I don't care if you ""can't take subtitles,"" or whatever. I can easily recommend this film to anybody. Please watch it and support foreign, arthouse, and indie cinema. But I implore you: go in blind.

And I'm hoping for a Best Picture win at the Oscars.

Bong Joon-ho's masterpiece."
4.5,2020.02.09,"You have to watch it for yourself to appreciate the story telling and cinematography. I'm a superhero, dumb action flicks type of person but once in a while I can appreciate a good film and this is it."
3.5,2020.01.05,"I do recommend this film but it definitely isn't the rip roaring masterpiece you read about comparing it to classics like The Godfather, Casablanca, etc. Why it received so many accolades is beyond me. Probably because it stuck out amongst a sea of mediocre films. The acting was fine. It's the story itself that left a lot to be desired. I really had high hopes going into this one. At least it didn't fall knee deep into the Korean trope of crying crying crying till every handkerchief is dripping wet."
5.0,2019.09.26,"This is , no doubt, modern masterpiece. Talent, imagination, wisdom, combined with actual theme make this one of the best movies in the 21-st century. Go and see it!"
3.5,2021.01.11,GOOD movie but itS not amazing This movie is overrated
0.5,2020.02.15,"This movie is trying to say that capitalism is causing both the rich and poor to become parasites - the poor are scam artists lying for money, and the rich are using the poor to nurture their kids. But it's a mess of a story, not a ""masterpiece."" In the real world, the poor definitely have to fight major barriers to get ahead, but this movie doesn't have any depth - the symbolism is amateurish, the characters are one dimensional and inconsistent, and the dialogue between rich and poor is totally unrealistic. The movie makes it seem like the poor are all scamming, bumbling psychopaths, and the rich are all naive and emotionally clueless. Sorry, it's an ignorant view of the world. It makes me realize how disconnected from reality the entertainment industry and its official reviewers have become. Or maybe Hollywood is trying to gain more money and audience share in overseas markets so they promoted this one."
5.0,2020.01.06,"Parasite stands atop the rest of the competition as the best film of 2019. Director Bong Joon-ho delivers his masterpiece, a film that has you hooked from the very beginning. Over the course of Parasite's runtime, it draws you deeper and deeper into its world, demanding more and more of your attention. Just when your investment in the characters peaks, Bong Joon-ho takes Parasite off the rails and delivers a striking message on the innate struggles between classes. Add in fantastic performances and cinematography, and you have the must-see film of 2019."
5.0,2020.01.08,"Just wanted to register my ""10"" for this movie. I'm late with this review and have nothing to add to the many other reviews previously posted."
5.0,2019.10.30,"Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose."
5.0,2019.12.03,My favorite foreign language film and definitely my top 20 if not top 10 favorite film of all time One of the most amazing story telling I have ever seen in a movie
4.5,2020.02.05,"The Academy Awards are in 5 days and Parasite is nominated for 6 Oscars, including best picture. I thought that the most simple comparison to make is between this and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Both films are entertaining throughout the entire run-time, but really blast off in a bizarre fashion in the final minutes. Parasite is at its best when it uses haunting imagery and compelling character relationships to drive the plot forward. This is one to root for at the awards."
4.0,2020.02.09,"Just saw Parasite for the first time with subtitles. For a foreign film from Korea, this is very accessible for all languages and audiences. The actors are all expressive, attractive, and do a really good job acting. The story has lots of universal, contemporary components to it of pop culture.

For what it's worth, the best way to describe this movie would be by calling it something like South Korea's ""City of God"", or something along those lines; what you have here is an impressive foreign film that is stylishly directed, well-written, and pretty gritty.

It starts out as a fun and enjoyable dark comedy, which slowly dwindles down during the second half when it becomes part thriller, part mystery (without giving away spoilers).

I wanted to give this movie the full 10 rating, but unfortunately I just could not. Sorry, but I had to question the ease at which the events unfolded, and that's not to say that it wasn't fun and perhaps it had to be that way to make the movie work, but there was slightly just enough questions to take it out of the ""perfect"" range of storytelling. The same issue also arose in the second, back half of the movie- some of the events that unfolded towards the end also raised some questions which cause it to not be a perfect 10.

However, other than these two (fairly big- big enough to deduct two points) flaws, the script is practically perfect, especially for a foreign film. The writers and director did a nice job of developing the story and added just enough layers to captivate, immerse, and challenge your mind, while also keeping it entertaining. They added just enough style to differentiate it and make it stand out as something thoughtful and creatively made.

I was hoping this would win me over for a Best Picture Oscar upset contender, but unfortunately, it just didn't quite prove enough to me to have confidence in that possibility. It could still happen, but after viewing it with an open mind, it looks like it's between Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and 1917.

EDIT: Slept on it and decided I would still pick this over 1917 because at least it had a script with some meat."
3.0,2020.11.16,"Mrs. Shullivan and I finally decided to sit down and read (English sub-titles) this 2020 Academy Award Best Picture winner and both of us felt it was decent enough, but to win ""Best Picture"" against a great film like ""Once Upon a Time In Hollywood"" I think director Quentin Tarantino was absolutely robbed. I guess when the USA is losing a lot of its film credibility with powerhouse producers such as Harvey Weinstein finally being put behind bars and the decades old USA social justice upheavel the Academy felt it was about time to suck up to foreign countries and give the Best Picture to another country to start showing they can be inclusive, so why not send some awards to South Korea?

We heard a lot of good feedback from friends and family about Parasite, and I would agree that the first half was decent enough, but the latter half I felt I was watching a cheap version of a Bruce Lee action film.

I really enjoyed the cinematography, and the set designs were eloquent, but the story failed to impress me and the character development literally fizzled, sort of like when in the 1939 Wizard Of Oz, the wicked witch of the west melted when water was thrown upon her. I cannot honestly say this was a memorable film, certainly not Academy Award Best Picture worthy, and I would not recommend this film as a ""must see"" such as the 2019 One Upon a Time In Hollywood is a must see at least three times.

I give Parasite a decent but no higher IMDB rating then 6 out of 10."
5.0,2019.12.19,"With this tough genre mix, South Korean cinema has created a masterpiece. The complex and fascinating examination of the class struggle once again underpins the ingenuity of its director Bong Joon-Ho."
3.0,2025.10.25,"I want my time back. I kept expecting it to evolve into somethig. It didn't. There were no twtists no evloution of the characters. Overall placing was slow and plot was meh.

The worst sin is , it wasn't entertaining. At the end of teh day a movie that doesn't entertain is a bad movie. Do you know wha ttha call a movie that teaches you something, a documentary."
2.0,2020.02.14,"Should have known when it got the academy award for best picture it would be disappointing. I really enjoyed Bong Joon-ho's Memories of a Murder and Mother. Unfortunately in this movie there was no character development and the characters were just stereotyped cliches. The less fortunate family was just a pack of sociopathic dirt bags and the well off family was laughable with its disinterested father, pretentious and anxious mother, the spoiled son who runs riot pretending to be a Native American as he preys on the house maid with his bow and arrow set, and finally the moody, withdrawn awkward daughter. The only character with any spark is the previous housemaid. The story plods along in predictable fashion with an ending without redemption or closure for any of these pathetic souls. For an academy award winner there were so many silly and unbelievable scenes where things magically disappeared from one scene to the next. Most notably, how the hell did the son in the less fortunate family get that rock back after his misfortune? See the movie and you'll see how ridiculous that is. The Morse code nonsense was tied together poorly and with little purpose. Movie ran out of steam at the end with nothing happening to leave the audience satisfied or even thinking about what just happened."
5.0,2019.10.20,"I am more than delighted to say that this twisted dark comedy from South Korea more than lives up to the hype. It was the recipient of the Palm D'Or this year at Cannes and has received universally ecstatic reviews. It's an absolute masterpiece, and one of the best films of the past ten years.

I won't say too much about the plot to avoid giving anything away, but the film tells the story of a poor family of con artists in South Korea who begin to start being employed by a gullible, extremely wealthy family. The narrative manages to effortlessly and seamlessly combine astounding entertainment with efficacious and impactful social commentary. The film is loaded with substantial messages about class divides not only in South Korean society, but also in the world as a whole. From there, its main raison d'être expands to the analysis of how we can respond to such divides when placed in extreme situations. The results are shocking, startling, hilarious, and utterly brilliant. Such results certainly couldn't be achieved without a truly outstanding cast, but lucky for us, Bong Joon-ho has assembled an astonishing ensemble. Even more impressive is the film's character development. While the film's primary characters are often not the most ethical, they are surprisingly likable and multi-dimensional--especially when heightened by both emotion and tone. You'll certainly remember them long after the credits roll.

But what's most unforgettable about ""Parasite"" is that the film manipulates (in the best way possible) its tone in so many unique and engaging ways, that it is able to fully subvert the viewer's expectations of not only how the film will go, but how tone in a film of any kind can be executed under normative conditions. Combining laugh-out-loud, witty comedy, taut suspense, and moments of pitch-black darkness, viewers will be fully immersed in one of the most unpredictable narratives put on film of the past twenty years. While such tonal shifts may sound erratic, they could not have been done more perfectly here--so much so that the film ultimately feels like an unprecedented crescendo in its tone--especially given that the tonal shifts are made more impactful by the film's almost impeccable tightness, not wasting a single frame to keep the viewer fully and utmost engaged.

One review cited in the film's trailer calls ""Parasite"" a ""magic trick."" I couldn't agree more, both literally and figuratively. A definite 10/10."
5.0,2019.11.14,"Don't read another review. Don't watch a trailer. As soon as you get the next opportunity, watch this film. That's all."
4.5,2020.01.23,"Directed by Bong Joon-ho. ""Parasite"" follows the members of a poor household (Kim) scheming to become employees of a much wealthier family (Park) by posing as unrelated, highly qualified individuals.

This movie exceeded my expectations. What a way to showcase class struggles and differences between the wealthy and financially lacking in brilliantly done social commentary! This movie feels like it's moving at lightning pace because of how effortlessly it flows. There isn't a dull moment to it, you're either on edge or learning more about it's well-defined characters. Each is distinct and so well performed. I recognized Korean-Canadian actor Woo-sik Choi from ""Train to Busan"" (he's looking fine in this too btw XD) as the brother Ki-Woo. I may be biased because I've grown to really like seeing him, but he was my favorite character in this film. I see him as the main character since he really starts the film with a conversation and ends it with a monologue to his father. Really well done, applause to you sir!

I loved seeing the scheming involved in this, with a name like ""Parasite"" I thought this was going to be sci-fi in nature. But it's not at all! It's more of a home invasion film where the rich owners willingly allow these people to come into their lives. The Kim family were some sneaky ba****** let me tell you and I loved it! It's like a better version of Ocean's films (sorry fans of that series), but with less heisting and more actual manual labour. But still a lot of deception, showing class division without making the rich too ""villain-like"". So seeing as the story/screenplay was superb, it's of course coupled with great camerawork/visual representations and an on-point soundtrack to back it up. There's some amazing parallel driven scenes that involve flooding that show that you don't have to treat an audience like they need to be spoon-fed information. Which I appreciate a lot! I'm so glad this film had a U.S. release because not having people over here see it because of subtitles...that would be tragic! I want more foreign films released in theatres over here to be honest!

This by far is one of the best films of 2019. It's thrilling, funny, tragic and very very intelligent. Please watch it if you haven't! I'm definitely going to have to check out more from the director/co-writer because he's impressed me highly and clearly is a master at his own craft. I love Asian cinema and foreign films in general, this is exactly why. You miss out on so much greatness if you stick to only ""your language"" while watching films. Don't be one of those people! I'm going to have to watch the movie a few more times to really pick up on everything. Also final side-note, the poster for this film is genius. You'll know what I mean once you've watched it."
5.0,2019.11.27,The movie is delivered so artistically while being interesting the whole way through. The hole the characters dig themselves into get deeper exponentially and you're completely on edge the last twenty minutes. Immediately after the movie I was shook to the core. Afterwards I had to do a lot of thinking to fully process what I just watched and understand the social messages. Amazing movie and I know for sure this is not going to get the attention it deserves because it is a Korean film.
5.0,2019.12.26,"Perfectly told story with perfectly logical plots and motives for every character, justification for every frame and accompanied by a thought-provoking message that lingers long after you leave the theatre. Surely one of the best of cinema."
4.0,2020.01.17,"The only reason I'm giving it a 8 it's because I wouldn't watch it again. Gave me so many emotions, it was a whole rollercoaster. I felt anxious, worried, sad, and even happy at some point. Made me feel fear at so many scenes, it really plays with your mind.

Masterpiece? Yes. Would I watch it again? Heck no."
3.5,2020.01.20,"Disturbingly good. Even though I don't like the plot and the ending, there are so many messages in the movie. And this is not american fairy tale, so watched it and I realized this movie was not made to entertain myself."

10/10 💸

""Such immense effort put into a film about the high and low class, Parasite is as surprising as it is a nail biter that keeps you guessing until the very end.""

The struggle of money is a huge and impactful aspect of the everyday lives us human beings go through everyday. No matter the case, desperation is imminent and dire actions come into play. Parasite does away with telling a tale of class, greed and the values or family. Director Bong Joo-ho, who brought you The Host and Snowpiercer, creates a layered masterpiece that keeps you on edge every second due to the flawless writing and acting within acting (if you watch you'll understand) that keeps Parasite from ever falling under. Even the score and cinematography assist the film in being anxiety inducing. Although it is considered a crime/comedy, I found Parasite to be a scary type of film. Think about it, manipulation can occur at the hand of anyone that remotely tries it, no matter how witty and/or smart the victim is. The horrors of reality stand and it is never too safe to be alert of the occurrences that surround you. Getting to the ending, which I will discuss briefly without giving anything away, is the kind of ending that provokes nervous laughter at the hand of suddenness and sensibility. It's one of those endings that involve so much, but that much just happens to work so well in the film's favor. It's haunting, it's daunting and serves the purpose of leaving a mark.

Verdict: Parasite is one of a kind and is easily one of the best films of the year. There's nothing to not like about this and it'll sure stay with you after the first viewing."
5.0,2020.01.16,"Brilliant . First time have seen a Korean film and cannot be more impressed. It's like Satyajit Ray meets Quentin Tarantino .. Social Cast issue with so many symbolysims meet brutal reality and violence.. depicted in a witty thriller .

5.0,2020.01.17,Just WOW. I loved every second of this film. The cinematography is on point! Such a beautiful film and such a great plot! Go see this movie!!
4.5,2020.02.09,"A family who doesn't have a lot of money or opportunities in life, starts working for a wealthy family. But will this change the life of the poor family?

DIRECTOR: Bong Joon Ho SCREENWRITERS: Bong Joon Ho, Han Jin Wan CAST: Song Kang Ho, Lee Sun Kyun, Cho Yeo Jeong, Choi Woo Shik, Park So Dam, Lee Jung Eun, Chang Hyae Jin In the movie, we follow the Kim family who doesn't have much money. By chance, the son in the family starts working for the wealthy Park family. He teaches their daughter English. Now the rest of the family sees opportunities to make money, and they have a plan to remove the rest of the staff who work for the wealthy Park family and then take the jobs themselves.

Bong Joon Ho addresses deeper themes, but he always manages to create entertainment and some surprising scenes that bring out the smile. The movie is mostly charming until the Kim family discovers the big secret of the house.

Then the movie starts to get darker, and it explodes into a wonderful finale where we see and understand the message of the movie. The title of the movie turns things on its head. Because what I thought to be quite obvious at the beginning of the movie is turned upside down and I got an aha experience. Parasites are found in all classes of society.

From a technical aspect I think this was a beautifully crafted film from the direction to the cinematography. There are so many beautiful scenes in the movie, and it's pretty well done considering that most of the action takes place inside the big house and the not so big garden.My favorite sequence is when the Kim family has to run home when the rain is pouring down, and you feel like they're on board the Titanic. They must run from the top and down to the engine room. What a wonderful sequence, and it's so beautiful to watch!

The cast was fantastic, and everyone fit the needs of their roles. The characters were well-written with the performances complementing that perfectly. It does a great job of creating a collection of characters that feel like real people, whom despite their eccentricities, maintained a grounded, realistic feel.The musical score complements the scenes nicely and elevates the emotional responses without feeling overbearing.

So, if you like foreign films, thrillers, or movies that can make you think a little check this one out. It's a crisp film from a technical aspect, and with a blend of great writing and acting you can't go wrong. It was a solid film that treats the audience with intelligence. 9/10"
5.0,2020.01.17,"First off, I feel like you either get this movie or you don't, that simple. There Is so much thought provoking duality that comes into play, those who rate it poorly seem to miss this part of the story. I don't want to give spoilers but if you truly allow yourself to go on the emotional roller coaster that this movie is, it will leave you thinking about all the twists and turns for days."
3.0,2019.11.13,"Kim K'atek and his near do well family literally living in the lower depths catches a break when their son obtains employment as a tutor for a wealthy family. Craftily the family conspires to inveigle its way into the household of the Parks by getting the chauffeur and longtime housekeeper fired and setting themselves up inside the lavish domicile with a Garden of Eden for a front yard. Things quickly take a turn however when the housekeeper returns for something she left behind.

Working with basically two class defining sets Parasite is a well filmed an interesting watch with the plot slowly unfolding in a darkly comic fashion before going into self induced chaotic free fall from the plausible to the absurd with a hurried climax and unsatisfying epilogue. Director Joon Ho-Bong and cinematographer Kyong pyo Hong do an excellent job of contrasting settings, situations, jabs about class and characters early, equally dividing the roles of his adult characters all benign and petty in their own way. It adds to the fascination of where this slightly off balance plot is going when the wheels come off. With no end game to the plot Ho-Bong decides to end it in conflagration and an insipid post climax that demands it defy logic."
5.0,2019.12.01,"Usually it has been observed that the movies start with high ratings because fans give the highest possible ratings initially but when more people watch them the ratings decline, but this one going up in the chart.

This says a lot about this one.

Another Korean master piece after Oldboy. Don't miss it, thanks me later."
3.0,2024.01.30,"Probably one of the most overrated movies in recent years. If I had to summarize this movie to someone that hasn't watched it I would say it's a movie about a poor family that manages to get into some rich family's house and they end up being killed by some random psycho that was hiding in the basement for years. I liked some parts of the movie, especially the first half but it kept getting worse and more random every second. What is the moral of this story? Not having a plan is always better? Life can change in a split second? I don't get the end of the story nor do I know why the guy decided to kill the people he killed. The definition of overrated."
1.5,2019.12.28,"Richly appointed, a glitterati champagne Cannes launch to an inebriated fanfare of stratospheric expectation, then unexpectedly in mid-journey an iceberg crash, an unsettling sinking feeling, followed by an agonizingly slow cascade into drowning horror. Compared to another mediocre superhero movie it might rank favourably, but a far cry from Tati or Hitchcock. Closer to a stylish 70s exploitation film."
4.5,2020.01.19,"This movie has 2 parts, the first one a kind of comedy, but too much smart, and the second is a complete tragedy, This year the Oscar Awrd is very interesting, there are wonderful movies and Parasite is one of them"
4.5,2020.01.21,"I've wanted to see this awhile, but the consistent rave reviews actually made me hesitate and put it off, for fear of disappointment...nothing is ever that good... but I genuinely and thoroughly loved this!

The themes are common enough, but told in such a way, and with such a unique story, to be legitimately fresh. The subtle nuances of performance can sometimes get lost in subtitles, but not in this case - each actor transcends language in conveying their character. The plot twists and turns between random chuckles and stark darkness from the start to the shocking, sad and satisfying finish.

The hype is real - definitely one of the best movies of the year, and of recent years. Don't miss it."
5.0,2020.01.16,"Bong Joon-Ho is an outstanding director, and this might be his best work yet. Parasite is one of the best movies of the entire decade, hell I'd go as far as saying no other movie this decade quite matches it. It's funny, it's heartbreaking, it's intense. It does all of this while not feeling tonally inconsistent or confused, which is something that many films fail to do. The acting is incredible and the characters themselves are fantastic, with no good guys or bad guys: They're people. They feel like real and believable characters, which is such a refreshing change of pace from all of the bloated action movies that we get every year. It's well shot, as to be expected, and the social commentary is fantastic.

This is the first movie I've seen in the longest time that I can describe as perfect, I loved every single bit of it."
5.0,2019.11.08,"Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in the recent years. The laughter, the suspense, the shock, ... and especially the hilarious twist in the middle! At the same time it presents a wonderful critique of society. I just LOVED it. Everything you'd expect of a Korean movie and more."
5.0,2020.01.09,"Last night was one of the most thrilling experiences I have had watching a film..

I attended a small arthouse theatre close to 15 minutes from my house. I finally saw a movie I had been yearning for some time. I am a little late to the party, in regards to my timing of this film. But I am ecstatic I got to view it in a theatre. I wanted to go in with no expectations, because typically I am let down. I have a tendency nitpick as a viewer, which can make some movies difficult to enjoy. I was aware that it had won best foreign film at the Golden Globes, and had received much critical acclaim. I cannot recall seeing another Bong Joon Ho film, except possibly The Host (in which case, it was so long ago- I do not remember). Either way, I was excited to see a movie that looked like a family drama, with perhaps some suspenseful elements.

As I sat in this small cleanly theatre, I noticed the majority of people were of Asian descent, and unless my eyes betrayed me, mostly Korean. I attend movies frequently and it was nice to see a very diverse crowd. As the lights dimmed and people munched on their popcorn, and drank their coke's; I sat there, by myself- as the only one in my row. Ready to have a fun experience, with what's been regarded as one of the best of the year. The first portion of the movie, centers around an engaging Korean family who live in a lower-class part of the city looking for jobs. They live in a home that is underground, but can still see the street through one of the windows. The family consists of a young adolescent brother and sister as well as their middle-aged parents. The movie begins with raucous laughs and instantly makes you engaged with these characters. The first 30 mins is truly a full-blown comedy and my theatre could not stop laughing. In its own right it is a very effective comedy, that had hints of possible dread ahead. The hints at suspense begin when another family is brought into the story. We see how both of these families become entangled in each other's lives, and how the threads are tied together. The pace was slower in the early stages, but still immensely entertaining.

Then there is a tonal flip. A character re-enters the story and you instantly feel tight. At this point you could not really tell where the story was headed, so I stayed in peak curiosity. Then comes a moment when dread absolutely swept over me and I felt as if the story was about to turn into a full-blown horror movie. I sat there in near dread, caught in my own amazement of what I was watching. The tension then softened a bit, but there was still an underlay of tightness. The whole tone of the movie had changed by this point, and you can feel the stress the characters are going through. As well as the fact that the viewer knows more than some of the characters on screen, so there are moments when you want to shout at the screen- DON'T LOOK THERE! Within a few minutes though, you are immersed in the new direction the story has gone in and what's happening. It was fun to follow the story's new direction, with a good level of suspense at this point. You can feel everything is on the brink of destruction, but its still being held together by a thread. Then the story levels off a little bit, heading an even different direction. In this sequence the story is setting up a finale, that will leave devastation. Once we get started in the third act, my jaw just about hit the floor and I was stunned. The final 20 minutes of this people was honestly breathtaking. The music, visuals, acting and the tone of the story hits you like a ton of bricks. By the time the final credits rolled, I sat there in utter amazement. It was the first time I left a theatre feeling utter euphoria. I was absolutely ecstatic with what I had just seen.

Parasite is a film that brings together a plethora of genres that all coalesce effectively. There is an underlying theme of classism and how the social construct of class impacts the psyche of the characters. But this is truly a story that has many layers, and the shifting tones create an atmosphere that is both eerily terrifying as well as holistically captivating.

Grade: A+"
5.0,2019.12.05,"Winner of the Palme d'Or for Best Film in Cannes 2019, to say «Parasite» is to speak of five shining stars in the cinematic firmament. When you have to spill blood in a film, you have to dose it with genius, hit the target and know where and when to spill it with cunning and, above all, understand well why we spill it and get the viewer to understand that reason as well.

Don't get me wrong «Parasites» is not a bloody drama, but a beautiful film that with humor and gravity touches the three classic themes of art: it is a tragicomedy about love, life and death, it is a film about the joy of living, about survival, about the family of the 21st century, but not like the concept of family defined and defended by many, that sick, stifled definition, confined to religious dogmas and eulogistic of expired and obsolete values. It is about real and living families of the planet in 2019, many dispossessed and a few privileged, in a game of services and currency exchanges, in the last days of capitalism with its agenda of violence, horror and death.

Although director Bong Joon-ho has already made about ten feature films of various themes, I only know one of his films, the cult fable «The Guest», a horrific science fiction tale about the relationships within a poor and dysfunctional family of Seoul, that is put in check when a monster generated by the toxins thrown into the Han River by an American scientist, kidnaps a young member of that family nucleus. Again, in «Parasite», Bong addresses the family issue, opposing a poor family made up of the parents and two children, to a rich family with the same number of members. The moment they cross roads is the basis of the story. A third component, personified by a housekeeper, gives an unexpected twist to the story and leads to the violent climax, which is not the end of the fascinating story; at this point of the story, it still has another 15 minutes of history to tell, until the sad final close-up that ends this work.

When I watch films like ""Parasites"" my heart skips a beat, I wish that people would have access to a wide and cultured film offer, that we all could see works like this instead of consuming the despicable L.A. garbage that the cinemas offer, week after week, freezing the reasoning of people from the whole world; or having to wait for an exclusive film festival to project them fleetingly, and to be subject to serials of thrones and other lousy dishes. As soon as «Parasite» appears through any of the windows we have today to watch movies, don't miss it."
3.0,2024.01.19,"So maybe I'm an uncultured swine or maybe some of the effect was lost in translation... but whatever it may be, I'm not sure I understand the hype around this movie.

Don't get me wrong, it was good... but it wasn't all that. To be honest I thought it was just above average. I think I may have liked it more if it was a bit more concise. The almost two hour long run time made it feel drawn out especially for nothing super intriguing taking place. There were definitely solid moments throughout, good acting and a general level of engagement, it just didn't super draw me in.

I think if I had watched this without being privy to any of the hype I might have liked it more, but I guess I was just slightly disappointed. Regardless, this is for sure a fun and thrilling movie that I would still recommend."
4.5,2020.01.14,"This film shows humanity in all its glory. We can try to claim the rich are evil and the poor deserve better but these are delusions we create to make us feel better. People are terrible. They are selfish. They are greedy. They are unkind. It's part of human nature. No matter how much you have, or how little, humanity still exists, and humanity is the problem.

All the problems in the world that make us suffer day to day are caused in the end because we are human. Nothing we can do about it.

The movie was good. Lol."
3.5,2019.11.03,"This movie is a vastly overrated film, but still had some cool moments. It just starts off very slow and the first hour is interesting but does drag on after a bit. The story is good, but it just goes on and on without any real purpose. It doesn't really go anywhere until the mid point, which has a really cool twist and you feel like the movie will bring up the topic of debt, but it just sort of stops. Then suddenly the final 20 minutes becomes Friday the 13th.

The biggest issue is that you never feel for the main characters. They have no backstory. They are poor, and nothing else. They can't even fold pizza boxes yet still complain when the owner takes off 10% from them. They are kinda unlikable and are pretty much scammers. They cost people their jobs by lying and we are supposed to feel bad for them? They go into people's house and stay there while the people go on trips. You just don't feel for them, and at the end they try to have this big emotional revelation but it completely fails. Why would we feel bad for a bunch of poor scammer who end up being murderers?

In the end it had some cool and intense scenes, a hot sex scene, some cool violent scenes, but it is not a masterpiece. The story really goes nowhere and in the end it just ends up exactly where it started. SNOWPIERCER is a masterpiece! Go watch that instead.

4.5,2020.02.01,"There are many reasons why Korean movies are a top notch and Bong Joon is definitely one of those. This Lynchian styled narrative is surely to take you for a ride. The movie starts with a light hearted tone but gets seriously dangerous with unexpected turns of events. The movie shows off the dark secrets of both rich and the poor and our judgement towards them. It's a confusing perspective for the viewer on who to feel sorry for, which side to take. Excellent!"
5.0,2019.11.02,"""Snowpiercer"" was very good, ""Parasite"" is even better! Bong Joon-ho delivers a clever analysis of the class society in which we live today in his ingenious thriller, which is horror film, comedy and drama at the same time. A poor family invades the home of a rich family and starts working for them. But who are the real parasites? The society of the rich is characterized by friendliness and serenity - but it's precisely this habitus that you first have to be able to afford. And it shouldn't fool us about the balance of economic power. We don't see good or bad individuals in ""Parasite"", rather Bong Joon-ho has created character masks for his characters in order to expose the class relations. Moreover, ""Parasite"" is a thrilling and aesthetically brilliant movie, in which there isn't a single wrong picture."
5.0,2020.01.29,"All the actors were convincing, intense performances by all of them. Great directing, art and photography. Some of the most beautiful shots I have seen , specially considering the places they were showing."
3.5,2023.09.03,"A movie that not only highlights the difference between the upper economy class and the lower economy class but also wraps around the emotions associated when two classes meet at some point.

If you are looking to watch something that's realistic, including drama, story, and emotions, PARASITE is one such movie. No spoilers, but it will leave a lasting impact in recognizing the everyday struggle of the earning member belonging to a lower middle class and how he has to go through tons of emotions hiding the pain from his family members.

While also, how such people aspire to become similar to the ones they are working for."
5.0,2019.10.12,"In an age of superhero movies (which I love) comes a story that is so captivating and engaging from early on that I hope it wins an Oscar. Unlike other years where the ""Oscar buzzy"" movies are really drawn out or not that great, this movie is something that everyone can understand and the story flow, twists and turns and commentary on society all are so well done. My wife and I loved this movie. This is definitely a classic."
3.0,2021.02.24,"I was looking forward to Parasite because of the very high rating and the 4 Oscars. Maybe my expectations have been too high for that reason. Anyways, someone has to explain, what on earth is so awesome in it. There is 1 Oscar for the story which is like: a clever poor family deceives a naive rich family.

But I can name hundreds of movies that haven't even been nominated in that category before, with a better story.

The actors do a good job. It is watchable to kill time. Yes. Some scenes are fun. Yes. Some people claim it is one of the best movies of the decade. Really? For sure, it is NOT one of the best of the decade. It's not a bad movie by any means, just overrated."
2.0,2019.11.28,Sometimes I really believe people are high when them watch specific kind of movies in festivals.
4.0,2020.02.09,Simply amazing! One of the best movies I watched in 2019. Keeps you on the edge all the way. Great flow. The end was something.
5.0,2020.01.08,"Are you kidding me, that this movie wasn't nominated at BAFTA, I guess all the people voting must have been too wealthy to understand this movie."
5.0,2019.12.24,"A movie that has an entertaining story in the surface and deep meanings as you dive in.

The director played it safe by introducing a simple story and gave it a god-tier build up with twisted plot. This is brilliant , you don't have to complicate it in order to get audience attention.

I am sure people will diverge and make speculations about the ending , and will never forget this movie as they live."
5.0,2019.11.18,"Edit: After the Oscars craze, i felt compelled to talk about the ""good, but overrated"" comments that I see more and more. Parasite is the perfect example of contemporary art. It's very easily digestible by the masses, as it is an objectively entertaining movie that even Marvel-DC-audiences can enjoy. However this movie is so layered that you can dig for days and still find hidden meanings and metaphors. They're subtle enough though, that a casual viewer can ignore them without loosing any part of the entertainment aspect. Those who seek an important and complex message can find it, and those who seek a 2-hour entertainment can also find it. Therefore we have the ""good, but overrated"" phenomenon.

I've just recently been introduced to the S.Korean film industry. After a long break from contemporary Hollywood movies, my faith and excitement for cinema has been restored thanks to S.Korean films. I firstly want to talk generally about the differences between big Hollywood blockbusters and what I've experienced with Korean cinema so far. Just for reference, the Korean movies I've seen so far are basically crime/drama/mystery movies with my top 3 being: 1. Parasite, 2. the Chaser, 3. Memories of murder. But there are many that I've yet to watch. What all of those movies have in common is the fact that they are not afraid to be a)real enough to make you relate and feel like you are part of that world, b)funny with respect to the story and the characters, and c) weirdly they felt like they weren't trying too much. I don't know if it's just me being sick of all the Hollywood's ""trying to be super cool"" act, but I find it refreshing to see a movie not talking itself too seriously, but at the same time handling very serious topics without losing the balance of all the above mentioned characteristics. And I find that very hard to do, it really is a thin line. I am so excited to have discovered S.Korean cinema, and i wish more people would not be afraid of the non-Hollywood film industry, as I was.

So, regarding Parasite. If you haven't seen the movie yet, and considering watching it, GO WATCH IT! Don't read anything else. Don't research and ideally don't even watch the trailer. This movie stuck with me for days after watching it. I wish I could forget what I watched and watch it again with a clean slate. What an experience it was! My spoiler-free thoughts: This movie is a master-class in film making and cinematography. All the symbolism and the brilliant shots were so subtle, nothing was thrown in your face. I would almost describe it humble in all its glory. This movie, even if you watch it on mute, has still a story to tell you. Absolutely genius! All praise to director Bong! I don't remember the last time I watched a film and didn't check my phone at all during it. I would say, most films, even the best ones, have some filler shots, meaning they have some kind of low energy points. Parasite had me hooked throughout every single minute of it. In other words, you will not get bored. It's so surprisingly entertaining through all its aspects and genres. Dark comedy, mystery, thriller, drama. They blend so good, and seamlessly that it's almost hard to pay attention to them, because the plot just unravels so naturally that it just seems normal to change the whole mood of the movie. Have you any idea how hard it is to do that, how complicated it is? But somehow Bong managed to make it look easy and natural. When I was a kid, I remember watching the Olympics with my dad. I mostly enjoyed watching the divers. I remember saying to my dad how easy it looked, and how I could probably do it, too (shame on my sweet innocent self, I know). And my dad responded with something that stuck with me: ""Whenever you think that something that somebody is doing looks easy, that is because they are freakishly good at it, and it's actually almost impossible to do by anyone else, and that they have failed and cried and almost gave up probably a million times"". So, respect to the professionals. This movie reminded me of that. Something extremely difficult that seems easy, and effortless."
5.0,2020.01.31,This is of the best original movies I have seen in a long time. I'm usually not a huge foreign movie fan unless it's a good horror movie but this movie really was that good. Just when you think you have an idea where the movie is heading it completely surprises you.
4.0,2020.01.30,"One of the best films! The way this movie takes you in the history is just the right way, everything connects perfectly. Well written and there is no notable mistakes. If you like thrillers and seen other things that American films this is the movie. One of the best movies in 2019"
3.5,2024.02.23,"I really enjoyed the opening scene of the boy, Ki Woo, taking the wrist of the girl, Da Hye, and taking her pulse to see if she could take the English exam. The scene in which the father and two sons escape from the villa, after locking the old carer and her husband in the basement, is beautiful. Now they are hit by an incessant rain like the worries of young Ki Woo. The father who, understanding the boy's state of mind, tries to relieve him of responsibility but this will not be enough. I didn't appreciate the generalization in representing people rich in money: poor at heart and foolish. I also failed to understand, due to my own lack of understanding, the meaning contained in the stone given as a gift by Ki Woo's friend to Ki Woo's family. The constant reminder of Ki Taek's bad smell triggered his anger due to his social condition and his lack of strength in reserving a different fate for his children.

Pressures and unexpected events are always present and the way we react to them characterizes us, what is your plan?"
5.0,2019.11.21,"This movie completely surpassed my expectations. This is a stunning piece of cinema. I gave it a chance because of the incredible hype surround it and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very unique experience. The vast spectrum of genre covered in this movie is almost unheard of. It's artistic, irreverent, creative, beautiful, funny, shocking, violent, emotional, inspiring, and compelling. It holds the viewer throughout and it continually build atmosphere. The absolutely insane and unpredictable nature in how things unfold and escalate was so much fun. The fact that the movie could navigate so many genres successfully whilst balancing a consistent tone, maintaining the entertainment, and never becoming boring is a rare achievement. The movie keeps you guessing and and it crawls under your skin exactly like a parasite. The ending is a wonderfully beautiful touch to the story.

I particularly loved how the director filmed the locations and used light, sound, and suspense to great effect.

I cannot recommend this enough.

GO. AND. WATCH. THIS. MOVIE. 10/10"
3.0,2021.04.16,"While many people seem to have enjoyed the wild mix of genres it left me emotionally detached. It starts as a fun plot about getting all members of a skilled yet unemployed...? Poor family working for a rich family without giving away that the poor people belong to the same family. Taking away from the fun is the fact that the poor family are just horrible people, getting rid of the last housekeeper by using her strong allergic reaction. When the rich family is away the housekeeper returns and for some reason the poor family lets her in...? She then discloses that her husband has lived in a secret underground bunker under the house for years after which the tension increases. The last part of the movie is more akin to a horror movie with a bloodie conclusion. All these tonal shifts made it hard for me to view this movie with any emotional attachment. I found myself analysing the movie more than enjoying it.

The performances of the actors seem stale and unmotivated with very little gesticulation or similar to express emotion (that might be a cultural barrier but reduced my enjoyment nonetheless). The soundtrack stayed in the background and I don't remember any of it.

The elephant in the room is of course the allegories and metaphors that everyone and their grandma seems to have found in this movie. While I agree with quite a lot of the findings considering that I have very little knowledge about south korea, metaphors do not make a movie magically better. While telling a simple story in a complicated way can be an interesting experiment, the movie cannot stand on it alone. I would not have enjoyed or rewatched Memento if its ""gimmick"" of telling a simple story chronologically backwards was the only thing it had to offer. The craftsmanship of Memento was really good from both actors and crew. I missed the good craftsmanship in Parasite, especially from the actors. If you enjoyed finding all the references and it made you think about certain topics and made you feel a certain way then that is great for you, but it is highly subjective and does not make the film ""the masterpiece of a century"". A good movie can have allegories and metaphors as the cherry on top. A mediocre movie does not become a masterpiece by putting in a ton of metaphors for complex topics and hoping to stand on only this one leg.

I might have honestly enjoyed a movie that consisted only of an expanded first section. With a more likable poor family, lots of shenanigans to keep undetected and a simple story, this film would have not received 4 Oscars and would not have been hyped like it has been, but it would have been far more enjoyable for me. But thats okay, movies are not just made for me, a lot of people seem to have enjoyed the movie, so its current form definitely has a right to exist."
0.5,2020.02.27,"When I find myself constantly looking at my watch and asking when a film is going to deliver any of the promises that the Critics and Reviewers have seen fit to lavish on it then there's something awry. This isn't scathing socio-political cinema...it's not black comedy, in fact it's not remotely amusing or believable or even sympathetic to any of its characters. It's a simple hype job. The movie here is the real Parasite."
5.0,2019.10.21,"A few moments into the movie, you start realizing that you are in the hands of a master storyteller, as without any exposition you are familiarized with all the characters and thier surroundings.

Director Bong Joon Ho has dabbled in murder mysteries, dystopian science fiction, as well as monster movies but this time he takes a very grounded and personal tale which makes you laugh, empathise, grin, and sit at the edge of your seat. By winning the Palme D'or at Cannes and hosting sold out screenings, Parasite had placed Bong Joon Ho in the cadre of the new masters of cinema.

The best way to to enjoy the movie is to go cluelessly into it, but what i can say about the plot is that it is flawless in writing and is edited to perfection. Not a single scene meanders and the story is tightly focused on the characters. Which brings me praise Kang-Ho Sok, who plays the father of the Kim family, making us sigh with his disappointment and smile whenever he takes pride in his family.

The cinematography in Parasite is a highlight as you get to see the grimy trinkets of Kim family's semi-basement house and polished expanse of park family's uptown villa. The background score selection is appropriate and perfectly blends in, while enhancing the drama.

While Parasite might be a suspenseful drama on surface level, it has layers to it in terms of metaphors and messages. It communicates class divide, makes us question the moral compass of the characters and ourselves, and makes you question: who is the real parasite in the movie?

Watch the movie and answer the question for yourselves."
5.0,2019.11.07,"This is one of those rare movies that actually transcend the astronomical hype surrounding it. So many elements of this film are packed with depth and richness. Funny, brutally sad, suspenseful, entertaining, and strange. Cannot say enough good things about the seamless transitions and rhythms of the directing.

Parts of this movie have been branded in my brain forever, and I'm completely fine with that.

I am huge Bong Joon-Ho fan, and this is his best movie to date. Right above Memories of Murder."
5.0,2019.08.28,"Tigers every human emotion

its hilarious its dark its original its powerful its thought provoking

time well spent"
4.5,2020.01.11,"Great movie, great writing, greating acting and great cinamotography. The only reason I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the ending.

I feel like filmmakers should have had the guts to leave the ending messy with a bit of mystery. After Mr Park gets stabbed they should have just ended it there, that would have had much more of an emotional effect on moviegoers."
5.0,2020.02.04,"Glad I watched all the other best picture noms first because now I KNOW they all pale in comparison to this one ... I couldn't even move for like the last hour, and the last 20 minutes my hands were over my mouth and didn't drop once.

A masterpiece."
5.0,2020.01.24,"I felt a roller coaster of emotions watching this movie; everything about it so perfectly executed. What makes this movie insanely good is the actors, story, plot and narrative.

Wow, just wow. I truly believe this movie, for me is going to be best movie watched for 2020. It's only January I know, but how the hell do you top this???"
3.5,2020.06.17,"You will not get bored, you will enjoy most of it, but it does not get that level of a masterpiece!"
5.0,2020.01.22,"Lot of comments on how this movie is mediocre and overrated I'm sure those people have rated starwars and avengers 10 on10. If you have watched some good old Korean movies such as bediveled, old boy, yellow sea and memories of murder you know this movie stands on equal footing with those movie I've watched joker Fordvs Ferrari Jojo rabbit 1917 Marriage story

Parasite beats all these movies by a huge difference."
3.0,2020.04.05,I could not quite grasp the idea of the movie because of the inconsistent characters. Very intelligent and resourceful Kim family living in the extreme poverty seems the weak point of the script. Unfolding of the events push the credibility of the movie to the level of cartoons watched by the kids. Watchable but not an Oscar movie in my opinion.
1.5,2020.07.18,"Can't believe it won both foreign and america best film. Some sloppy writing for instance. The Kim family is drunk in the Parrks home..All of a sudden they become sober. They throw glasses and bottles on the floor, then its cleaned up with no one cleaning it. When the two kids are under the ottoman hiding, theres no sign of broken anything. Also, the ex maid has been hiding her husband in the cellar for years (why) and she's been moving the big chest to get down there to care for him all these years. Then when she returns she can't open the secret door so the Kim family can see her. How did she manage all the years before this particular night. The film is very mean spirited and theres nobody to root for except for the poor man who gets killed. Again, sloppy writing. The premise is good but the execution is bad. Oh, and the young kid gets strangled and his head is hit with a large rock. He recovers with nary a scratch. Again, poor writing. Movie makes no sense. On the plus side, the acting is good."
4.5,2020.01.11,"Cinema at its best. Hi I'm Steffany. World Cinema has got to be apprecited. Enough of Titanics, and Avengers already!!"
5.0,2020.01.18,My favorite movie of 2019.. Hope it gets Oscar for best Picture
5.0,2020.01.13,"This movie is a masterpiece I really had good times watching ever minute of it. From the topnotch storytelling to the ideas it portraits, its definitely a movie that will stick in your head far after the credits."
5.0,2020.01.17,"Parasite is a very rare film. IMDb have it listed as a 'Comedy, Drama, Thriller'. These three just don't do it justice. It certainly has some very funny moments ... but it's equally depressing and sad (both in a good way) as it deals with tough subjects like injustice, poverty and class. It certainly is a drama; each character has multiple situations ranging from normality to crisis. We watch as these scenarios merge and cultivate themes and topics to contemplate. Yes, you guessed it ... it's also a thriller; the storytelling beautifully builds up, twists and works to a crescendo.

However, the film has so much more. There's plenty of argument to add 'Horror, Romance or Crime' which are all blended into the colourful narrative. Plus, this film is the quintessential 'Family' film; yes, the families are in 'interesting' situations, but the shades develop and raise questions on many layers. The fact this film can do all of this and stay even remotely coherent explains why the film is rare. The credit should go to the sharp writing and directing of Bong Joon Ho and the brave and touching work of the actors.

Now ... it's a long way from 'perfect' in my opinion. I've scored this film a 10 here as it just crept into the required range with 91/100 using my own scoring system (I have my own detailed method). It's certainly true that some people won't enjoy this film. Of course, the genre mix I describe above may put people off straight away. Without saying too much that gives anything important away some might feel the underlying themes have been done before and that the film can feel confused and ambiguous (on a variety of subjects and positions). You may also need to deal with a film without an obvious 'hero', characters with whom you may struggle to empathise (especially by the end) and an 'unlikely' main plot and close.

Personally, none of these impacted my enjoyment of the movie in a significant way. I'd primarily put this down to the direction, screenplay and acting. There are small moments in the film, which resonate as they underpin the themes. I found 'Parasite' thought provoking and engaging throughout."
4.5,2020.01.11,"I doubt that there's a better film out there than this masterpiece in 2019!

Almost everything about this film was perfect with numerous messages, elements and layers.

The production and performance were magnificent. The humour ""Black comedy"" was great, the ""Pain"" was real and the cinematography was dazzling.

I'd like to thank Bong Joon-ho in person for this masterpiece!

""Poverty and being indecisive can make life a perfect mess and miserable""

9.2/10"
4.5,2020.01.16,"The film is a contemporary cinamatic adaptation of the Sisyphus myth. You will even find the stone, symbolically appearing at many scenes."
3.5,2021.10.30,"Parasite landed with a massive splash in 2019, Bong Joon-ho's satirical black comedy is excruciatingly tense and a fantastic confection. Its bracing cynicism makes it drop slightly short of being a clarion call to revolution and it has a few too many endings for me but the unpeeling of this particular onion is tremendously fun. It's easy to see why it did as well as it did."
5.0,2019.11.02,"This is a very rich film ""with metaphors"" as the young hero of it might say. It is very compeling viewing from its first minute as the direction, writing and acting are very cleverly done. The themes of the have-nots against the haves and the cold-hearted versus the warmer-hearted people dominate the plot, which is thick. There is a lot of symbolism in it. Who are the real parasites, anyway: the poor or the wealthy, the caring or the indifferent? The tone takes a turn three-quarters of the way through from French-farce style to almost a horror film. However, it is worth engaging in until its conclusion, as it has some serious messages for the viewers and is a very wise work indeed. I can see why it won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2019; it's a gem."
3.0,2021.04.11,It was a disappointing. It was not bad. But it was to long. And the story starts strong and then the story changed from poor people to smart people and back to stupid people. The rich family didn.t do anything wrong. In my opinion you don't hated both families. So at the end i was thinking: Where is the rich family? I didn't get any connection with the poor family.
1.5,2020.02.18,"Once again the Academy Awards get it wrong. Awards for film are meaningless and superficial. I've never been a fan of the art house genre. However, I do appreciate the films of David Lynch, and I believe he's the only one that has turned art house into a fine art form. I bet five dollars that the six hour long sequel to this film never sees the light of day at HBO. It's too soon after the disaster that was GoT. Parasite was too slick and packaged for mainstream consumption. Much like the human branding it so desperately tried to spotlight. I could think of a hundred foreign films the Academy passed over for Best Picture for some American made drivel. This film was not one of them. Down with all awards shows!"
5.0,2019.11.14,"Bong Joon-ho seems to be incapable of making a bad film and this one might be his very best. Parasite is wickedly funny, stunningly tragic, and just gorgeously constructed from beginning to end.

The visual storytelling here is immaculate, the stair sequence, in particular, is incredibly crafted.The sound design and soundtrack are superbc subtle and strong in all the right places.This is probably the best-paced film I've seen this year, there's virtually nothing I could think of to trim.

I am deliberately avoiding talking about the film in more specific terms, you don't need me for plot summary there's plenty of that online already. Though I would suggest avoiding all of it if you really want to get as much out of this film as possible. Family is certainly a strong theme as is class struggle if that helps.

The acting is all excellent. Song Kang-ho continues to be one of the best actors working today. The dude will have you cracking up and then choking up within minutes of each other.

I'm not really able to talk about this film at length without spoiling it so I'll just say if you're a true fan of film, this is not one you can miss. This is the type of movie that reminds people why they love film in the first place.

10/10 First a trickle, then a flood"
5.0,2019.12.24,One of the best Drama-Thriller movie I have seen in years. Plot is fresh as ever. Cinemetography and character developement is at its best. Want to see more movies from Sir Bong Joon-ho.
5.0,2020.01.28,This film will take you throw comedy and sad and madness times...its just a good one that any one can see all of it on the edge of his chair...the movie has a great story with unexpacted events....from the best in this yeare 2019
5.0,2020.01.26,"I want to say so much about this powerful movie but it is clear from the scores and reviews it is compelling, thought-provoking and subtly absorbing.

Suffice to say it's a must watch for anyone who is intreagued by the class decides and struggles of society perfectly framed in a culture of academically hungry people.

This beautiful movie crosses many genres and does a fantabulous job of letting you be thoroughly taken into the lives of each character without any judgement to their respective plights.

I am left with a silent revilaey that hard work can be a poisoned chalis if it has no real meaning, as much as luck and wealth can leave you unfulfilled if you don't look down with compassion.

Or was it all just a metaphor? If so, what for? I, for one, don't care."
5.0,2019.12.22,Everything about this film is simply perfect. Absolutely perfect encapsulation of the stunning creativity and capabilities found within South Korean cinema as of the last couple of decades.
5.0,2020.01.02,"Midway through the brilliant and deeply unsettling ""Parasite,"" a destitute man voices empathy for a family that has shown him none."
3.5,2024.11.01,"A raw portrayal of South Korean society, where wealth inequality is at an all-time high. The film depicts a poor family forced to survive by clinging onto - even parasitizing - a wealthy household. The harsh reality it unveils is more brutal than I ever anticipated. The title may sound like Japan's Parasite, but there's nothing supernatural here-just the raw, complex layers of human nature on display. I don't want to spoil anything, but the tragic end for both the rich and poor families speaks volumes. This isn't just a glimpse into South Korean society as seen on TV; it hints at darker, more horrifying societal issues lurking beneath the surface."
5.0,2019.12.28,"I absolutely loved this film!, the best of the year by far in my opinion. Everything was masterclass, the acting, directing, writing, tech aspects. lol in my top 100 for sure."
3.0,2020.06.20,But I really don't love it as much as all the fuss. It did not deserve to sweep the Oscars. Didn't love it
1.5,2020.04.23,"The movie itself starts fine. The pace is interesting and such, until that... It basically doesn't has too much to offer. It has some suspense and some insane plot twists, but that's basically it and I don't understand all the hype revolving this film."
5.0,2019.11.29,"Parasite is perfect reflection of the era that we live in. I believe it is not coincidence that while we are witnessing demonstration all over the world caused by ecenomic disparities, a movie like Parasite ( also we can add Joker) is publishing. Parasite is brilliant class struggle movie. Fim starting with a lower class family who are living in a high class family's house as parasite. After the end of the movie I started to think that both family was parasite. Rich family, who are enable to handle daily difficulties, is in need of labour class. And Kim family using their need by cheating them. Things I like: #Park family's wannabe, American and the Indian references #Elevation allegory between houses of the families and the social classes #Rainfall sequence (Masterpiece directing !!) #Wrestle of cockroaches to keep the house and the owners of the house does not aware of what is happenning. #Below the coffe table scene #Production of sets #Rising of tension until the birth day party #Smell of poorness

I did Not like: #Last 5 minutes ( I thing it was not necessery to show us what happened after the birthday party)"
5.0,2019.11.28,"First and foremost, this movie is a must watch! It starts funny, becomes interesting, and then holy ****! The writing, directing, cinematography, and acting are all masterclass. To sum this movie in a few words I would say it's a dark comedy tragedy(if such a thing exists). Also, if you see this movie and want more check out the director's other movies that are also great; Snowpiercer, Mother, and Okja. Most of his movies, including Parasite, are about the classes we fall under and even though we may be from the same country, same race, whatever, we still see each other so differently because of this."
4.5,2020.02.09,"I didn't know what to expect from Parasite. After a few minutes, I found myself with the same feeling in my gut as the first time I saw Rocky. I was really rooting for this impoverished but street smart, underdog of a family. The story moved forward and I found myself not sure of how I felt about them and their charade. The acting and directing are tremendous! The pace of the film leaves you suspended in anxiety. But what an incredible film it is. Without question one of the best films I've seen in the last five years. Certainly the sleeper film for the Academy Award. Excellent, 9/10."
5.0,2020.01.06,"It was a wonderful movie, truly! I did not expect that level of acting and the way the movie was shot really stands out. It was, amazingly enough, filled with humor (both dark and stupid humor, the whole room was straight out laughing at some points! ), love, hate and passion in a way that I cannot describe. I jumped and screamed in my seat several times and by the time i left the movie theater my heart was pumping in my chest and I felt like I just had completed a marathon. My head is still spinning from all the plot twist, that I did not see coming! 10/10 would always recommend and hope to see it again soon!"
5.0,2019.10.10,"Man, where do I even begin? Let's start with the technical aspects. It is shot very well, the production design is so good that I couldn't tell what was real and what wasn't, the acting is phenomenal (especially from Joon Ho favorite Kang-Ho Song), and the score is the best of the year so far.

And now for the story. Just wow. The script tackles so many complicated themes about society and class flawlessly, and it developes all of the characters perfectly. There are about 8 main characters, and they all feel like actual people and not objects for the story. The situation that the characters get in is very interesting and thrilling. This is the best film of the year, and one of the best ever. Just watch it."
4.5,2020.01.29,Great movie! I didn't expect that. I actually just watch it because it was nominated to the oscars but ended really enjoying it. It's definitely going to win best foreign movie
,2020.12.18,"Like everywhere else, there are the successful and the not-so. In this film, the bottom dwellers (the Kim family) live in a basement suite and do odd jobs. One day, they use a scam to infiltrate a rich family (the Park family).

In typical Asian manner, the employers don't check job references or do a criminal background check. Depending on personal introductions and a superficial assessment at the job interview. Such is the dependence on the sanctity of Confucian social relationships.

Naturally, the amoral Yi family take full advantage of the naive gentile Mrs. Park. Behaving in an atypical Asian way to eliminate the other servants.

Add the complication of a debtor hiding in a secret basement. Preferring self-imprisonment to life as an outcast above ground.

Eventually, there is tragedy as the past of the deceitful people catch up with them. Bringing death to the Park family.

Excellent direction and acting. Quite convincing.

Like the film Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, this film offers insights into Confucian society. About ideals and the failures to meet the standards."
3.0,2019.10.17,"Cinematographically really an awesome film, great actors, storytelling, gripping. But maybe it´s only me, I can´t make out a plot that ties all together, unfortunately. So it remains a bunch of snipets, greatly shot clips, but the story loses itself if not in the worst of all, in oceandeep hopelessness, it is the saddest experience leaving the theatre. 9 for the pictures, 1 for the story. sorry no."
5.0,2020.01.02,"I really love the way they mixed thriller and comedy, when it got serious it got really serious, when it was funny u would laugh your ass off. Definitely one of the greatest films ever made. I really didn't want it to end, but all good things must come to an end"
3.0,2020.01.01,Definitely not worth more than 8 stars. A good movie to watch at home but not at the theatre.
2.5,2020.01.06,"Parasite is itself a parasite of a movie. The start is interesting and the cinematography is excellent throughout the film. It's a lot of fun seeing the street life of this poor family and their living conditions. There are some very unlikely manuplations involving job positions which are all too quickly accomplished and never entirely believable in their successful execution. What kills this film is the ridiculous second half of the movie and ending. This is It makes you wonder if they had a new writer finish the story up. One who just wanted to create an ending and had no concept of how to do it. Because there was some good acting and great film work, I gave it five stars. But it probably rates less due to bizaare and impossibly stupid parts to the movie."
5.0,2019.11.03,"This movie has it all. Great script, outstanding acting, the drama, the comedy, the thrill, the cinematography and an amazing director. Incredible movie."
5.0,2019.12.06,"This movie is easily the best of the year in the entire world. The legendary director Bong joon-ho known for his movies (memories of murder, the host, snowpeircer, okja) churns out yet another masterpiece "" parasites"". The movie completely engages you through its brilliant storytelling. The comedy , humour, suspense , thrill and drama elements keeps you hooked into the screen. The peformance of all the actors are top notch. The flim is a visual treat filled with lot of suprising moments. Its very rare to see such kind of story telling on the screen kudos to the director bong joon ho and his team for experimenting with such theme. The movie is by far the best in its genre and will be remembered as a classic. It wont be wrong to say that this movie is definitely among the finest movies made in this decade."
5.0,2019.11.12,"This film deals with the genre freely. The director's originality, completeness, artistry, and popularity were well harmonized."
5.0,2019.10.27,"This film is a powerful parable. If you like straightforward Hollywood films - with good guys and bed guys and an obviously predictable plot - DON'T see this film. It will leave you confused, even annoyed. If, on the other hand, you want to see a film that will make you think and reevaluate your view on modern human society, it is a must see for you."
5.0,2019.09.05,"I had a very high expectation for ""Parasite"", I believed the hype and I was right! 'Parasite' is what we can call a high level motion Picture in terms of everything. The story itself is funny, intense, terrific and dramatic at the same Time. You go through a lot of emotion, from an enormous laughter to an enormous sadness, to compassion and suspense. It shows not only a society problem but also a suggestion of solution. More, the film is perfectly directed, written and shot, to make you intro it easily. The unanimous Palme d'Or is 100% deserved. See it by yourself, believe the hype, and you'll never want it to finish. Congratulations Bong!"
4.5,2020.01.27,"This film is really good and makes you think deeply about the situations it shows. The duality between the protagonist family and the rich Park's is shown in such a wonderful, realistic manner. This type of storytelling has been long missing and I hope more movie makers follow in this trend - in their own original way of course.

My one complaint was that the film is slow in some middle parts; some scenes last longer than they should. This could be a cultural difference in film-making, as another South Korean film I watched had these instances as well. Still, it's not enough for me to completely give up on it. It's a proper thriller, American films have tried to pull this off throughout the whole of last decade, but failed (with the exception of ""Get Out."") You laugh, you're sent to the edge of your seat, you get angry, and finally you feel sad. You know a movie is great when it's able to awaken so many emotions and leave you talking about different interpretations of the film long after you've watched it.

I'm glad South Korean films are getting the attention they deserve. I've watched other South Korean films in the past and they are excellent storytellers. Congratulations to everyone involved with this film, you all did an amazing job and I'm happy your hard work has been recognized on an international level.

Highly recommend this film and if you're avoiding it due to subtitles or the non-sensible bad reviews, you're sorely missing out."
,2021.01.19,This family is so entertaining and real and the story is so so real and engaging and it has such a strong message about status and class!!! I really enjoyed it!!!
3.5,2020.03.07,Literally the movie was good until the last 30 minutes were literally nothing main sense !!
4.0,2020.01.17,"I guess people can never fully understand poverty and what it can do to people. This is a very very powerful film. Very clever. But even this film can't depict the real poverty. If you've watched it and are reading this very review, you ain't poor. The real poor don't watch this film. This film might have depicted struggles. But real life is on another level.

And no I don't know what it's like either. But I can get a good taste of that idea when seeing the predators in the wild showing that numb gaze when they bites the neck of their prey. On their fierce face I don't see any extra thoughts. No concerns about ethnicity, pain or morality. But the absolute focus to end this hunt as quick as possible so that it could become dinner.

There isn't any flamboyance in that. There is only straight up desire. And the feed for that desire."
3.5,2019.08.27,"Parasite is a South Korean Movie directed by Joon Ho Bong, who also directed Snowpiercer, Okja, and most brilliantly Mother. Now this movie probably has more twists and turns than any of his other films, which is saying a lot.

You never know where the story is headed so there's a lot of suspense throughout the film. At first, you're given a glimpse into the lives of a family living in wretched poverty. Their wifi doesn't work, their basement dwelling gets flooded, and worst of all the local drunk pisses right outside their door. Perhaps this is what makes the family turn into a band of scam artists. That's actually one of the things that bothers me about the film. All of the family members are fully integrated in the criminal activities without any second thoughts about how it will affect the victims. I wanted to see more fleshed out characters who question each other and themselves. I wanted there to be a reason for their turning out the way they did. Poverty isn't enough.

Even so, the cataclysmic turn of events is more than enough to keep you engaged. The conniving planning that goes into their schemes keeps you entertained for the first hour. After that a curveball is thrown at them, as well as us, the audience.

And again more characters are shown to be treacherous without any explanation as to how they arrived to have that mindset. I'm sorry to point this out again, but it gets irksome. I expected more from the director of the masterpiece, Mother. That is a film that kept me engaged because the characters had motives, even though those motives were somewhat ambiguous. Despite all my criticisms, Parasite is a suspenseful thriller with plenty of content to keep you enthralled for its entirety."
0.5,2019.12.30,"I'm sorry, am I missing something here? Every celebrity, message board poster and even the former President of the United States Obama are saying this was the best movie of the year.

It's just not good! Why is this being considered one of the best of the year? I'm totally lost. This is one of the most forgettable movies I have ever seen. To put it bluntly, even Michael Bay's worst Transformers movie is better than this dreck.

I came into this movie thinking it was going to be the next City of God based on the hype. It's actually on the level of a movie on Netflix that I'd spend five minutes on before skipping to the next film and clicking ""thumbs down.""

Don't waste your time, trust me on this.

I forgot to add, it's very obvious that whoever made this movie ripped off Shameless in many ways. They were definitely inspired by it."
5.0,2020.01.20,The best movie l've seen! I wanna see it again! You mast see!
5.0,2019.05.30,"As a long-time fan of Bong and Song, I always knew this pair would make it at Cannes someday, and finally!!!! ^_^ (~Naneon Bong-iiyah~) I purposely never watched a single trailer of this in order to fully enjoy it and I'm glad it turned out Bong had made up for Ok-ja very successfully. Also, I'd like to add that Moongwang, the former housekeeper was ridiculously good. Despite all the laughs throughout the movie, it's quite bitter and sad and gets you thinking of the modern hierarchical, absurd society where we live in, all the way back home. I hope Bong's next movie would be just as good as Parasite."
5.0,2019.11.06,"""Parasite"" Review (10/10)

Snowpiercer director Bong Joon-ho has made a South Korean social satire that's also a genre-bending Palme d'Or-winning thriller of class struggle. It's best to go into ""Parasite,"" the Cannes Film Festival grand-prize winner by Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, not knowing too much about what you're about to see; the better to let its sly power sneak up on you. A dark satire of the class divide in contemporary South Korea, it's the story of two families of four. You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker; only wondering when it's over how certain effects were achieved (a sequence near the end is a wonder), and losing yourself in these characters: particularly the gentle, wide-eyed anxiety of Mrs. Park and the way that Ki-woo's father, a man who cheerfully recites his string of failed businesses, remains determined to somehow find a way to make his family prosperous again. The title metaphor becomes abundantly clear, is filled with vivid conversations that remind us how the Parks can't imagine (or don't care to imagine) how the other half lives. In one scene, they coolly discuss how poor people smell; like an old radish, says Mr. Park, or a rag that's been boiled. Ki-woo's family, however, seems to understand the rich all too well. What keeps you rapt in Parasite is the visual wit, every shot distills the movie's themes, and the richness of the characters and performances: Song's stricken expression as Kim Sr. is driven to murder by class resentment, Lee Jeong-eun's swift transformation from a calmly efficient housekeeper to a keening madwoman, and Choi's eloquent helplessness as his teenage protagonist watches this new world order gorily combust. At the heart of Parasite is the most gnawing evolutionary fear of all, the inability to protect one's family. Parents work to save their children but lose them, as children lose their parents and wives their husbands. The bonds are firm but can withstand only so much pressure before they fracture. Who are the real parasites? The poor who attach themselves to the rich or the rich who suck the marrow of the poor? The movie dissects the universal gap between the haves and the have-nots with shocking wit, stinging topicality and gut-wrenching violence. It's explosive filmmaking on every level."
5.0,2020.05.07,"Possibly the best film I've seen for some time, yes I have a few lockdown blues, and needed something to cause a bit of escapism, Parasite was the answer. It's one of those films that's almost impossibility to classify, it doesn't really fit into any specific genre, but covers almost all of them.

A great start, it holds your attention incredibly well, I enjoyed the latter stages as much as the first part of the film, I know some didn't. It just moves you into a totally different place.

You'll laugh, and cry, you'll lose yourself in the wonder. Do yourself a favour and order it, 10/10."
5.0,2020.01.16,Far and away one of the best films you'll ever see.
4.0,2020.02.08,I don't watch many non-english language films but I think Parasite is worthy of worldwide recognition for being an exceptional film. Although I don't see it as a masterpiece I think there are a lot of high-level elements of filmmaking in this. The plot seems simple enough but there is a lot of depth in the writing and storytelling to warrant multiple viewings. The acting is great as well as the direction but I'm always feeling like I'm missing the full experience when subtitles don't convey the subtleties of the language and cultural references. But that just goes with the territory if you happen to be from a foreign country. 8/10
,2020.11.30,"I feel like I've learned something from watching this, I'm not sure what yet, but I loved it!

I didn't realise it had comedy in it, but feel like I laughed in all the right places.

The acting was superb and the whole concept of the had me fascinated and completely immersed.

I'm going to recommend it to friends but not sure how yet. I guess I'll tell them have an open mind and go with the flow, as it's an original and fascinating experience in film making and class culture. Something like that, I'm going to have an enjoyable rethink about what I just watched.

In fact I've decided I'm definitely going to watch it again at some point very soon.

Bravo 9.5/10"
3.0,2022.04.13,"This is way way over rated, its a 6 at best. Yes some bits are funny. But others it just drags on. The actings okay. Plots okay. Its just really an okay film overall. Nothing special."
5.0,2019.09.09,"Absolutely breathtaking, easily one of the best movies of this year!"
3.5,2020.02.23,"This movie is nice and the idea is interesting, but it's not the best movie of 2019, it's totally overrated."
0.5,2020.01.09,"The west favors the films that look western in its aesthetics and treatment. This film is the example. A commercial, illogical potboiler with not one original character. This film can be compared to a number of Hollywood, European cinema. Everything is stupid and illogical. An entire family cons another entire family into entering their home as servants in various capacity. Top it with a secret bunker in the basement where the previous servant has kept her husband to save him from debtors?! And the owners of the house, a family of 4, has no clue about any of it, despite all these happening right under their noses for years? Sounds stupid and illogical and nonsensical. Sounds like a Hollywood B comedy movie starring Queen Latheefa, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrel and other SNL cast members."
5.0,2019.12.28,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. I don't usually give 10 points, but the film impressed me. (It's been a month since I'm still in effect.) The way he describes events and emotions is very interesting. I follow South Korean films as much as possible. I have not seen this kind of narration either in South Korean cinema or in other countries. I would really recommend to anyone interested in cinema and looking for new things. bong joon ho is an excellent director. Every job is getting better and better."
5.0,2019.11.18,"Incredible film making, acting and story. Really transported me."
5.0,2020.02.10,"When I heard about Parasite, I heard about the overwhelming praise first. Normally when a movie gets a 99% on RT i end up liking them but I never rave about them (Boyhood and Get Out are prime examples). So i went into Parasite with caution. But i was wrong. It really is THAT good. Not ""good"" its Excellent. Brilliant. Genius. I could go on and on. From the masterful direction to the cinematography and production design, the acting, the script; its all perfect. I don't want to give away anything because if you go in completely blind, you'll walk away with the best film of the year worming through your brain."
5.0,2019.10.30,"THATS THE WHOLE POINT! ive seen some reviewers here say that the poor family infiltrating the rich family so easily and skillfully felt like a ""feel good movie"" to let us root for the underdog people and cheer for them when they succeed... the directer clearly intentionally led the plot to be such... so when the later half begins we begin to wrestle with thoughts like the morallity of the rich and poor families.. Are the rich really ""evil"" for ignoring the poor? Does the poor have the right to fool and steal from them? How people dont get the point of social commentary and only focuses on plot details and improbablity is just sad.."
5.0,2019.12.28,"This movie starts off with a seemingly predictable start, a poor kid pretends to be a college student in order to be an English tutor for a rich girl. But what unravels is an extraordinary story of power, greed, insanity, manipulation, and false appearances. It's a slow rise to disconcerting, uncomfortable, and then all of the sudden, it is disturbing and gory and... insane.

There is no way to see what's coming next, I promise you that. Now that's a real thriller.

Highly recommend. The ending leaves questions unanswered, but many opportunities to philosophize on humanity and class."
5.0,2019.11.05,"I have seen every film he has made other than his first film. I liked them all but felt all of them were overrated other than Memories of Murder. I felt that second film of his was his best until Parasite . I loved every frame of this film. And such a creative plot. This is easily my favorite non American film in years. It is the kind of film that you see with a friend or your partner and want to discuss for hours. It is not a film I really want to discuss too much.The less you know the better. The purpose of this review is to tell people that have felt the same way about Bong Joon-Ho as I have in the past, that this time all the accolades are deserved. This is a true masterpiece that will be studied for years to come in film classes all over the world."
,2019.10.27,"Looks great, smells bad. That's the overall message and reality of this movie. After so much hype and high reviews, it's amazing to see that the whole thing could have been avoided if : a) dude didn't smell, b) dude didn't say that dude smelled or c) dude didn't hear that dude said he smelled. If that's all it takes to radically change your film then you need to do a rewrite. It's not about class, or social blah blah, or injustice or wealth or yada yada yada, it's about smell and this movie is a stinker. Ca pue!"
3.0,2022.05.20,"So, I finally watched Parasite. While the film was not bad and had a different view on social disparity between rich and poor, I still think that this film did not deserve to win best picture at the Oscars.

For a best picture type of film I expect more: Top visuals, scenery, camera, sound effects, music, mixing, wardrobe and of course great actors and a really great story. While those actors weren't especially bad, they were not great either. Especially the rich woman acted over the top.

Now the story: For me this story was unfolding to easy, too cheap. At the start of the movie, the poor family is depicted as lazy and especially the parents seem to have bad manors. There are those kind of poor people that got hit hard by economy and try to work their way up again. And there are those that just live on the money of others and are not willing to work hard themselves. The family in Parasite falls into the second category. They are not even able to fold pizza card boxes correctly. Nor do they care to present good work results or make a good impression to keep their jobs. Yet this same family is able to get jobs at a rich familiy's home and those rich people (the father is a business man - so not a dumb person) aren't suspicious or realize that they are impostors (the lazy woman from the start now runs the whole household as a maid???). Nor do they ask their rich friends or business partners if they know someone for a driver's or a maid's job. Nope, they just pick the first one that someone unknown recommends that worked for them for just a few hours.

The ""worst"" about the story: I could not sympathise with the poor family in the end. It was not like ""Yeah they were treated unfair by society and had to live a poor live in the basement, they deserve better"". In contrary. Especially when they found out that the former maid has hidden her husband in the basement for several years, this parasite family does not connect with those people. They don't treat them better like they were treated before by richer people. They instead want to call the police. And when the former maid finds out that this family are impostors, she also does not connect with them, but tries to blackmail them.

So the morale of the story is: Poor people are as bad as rich people and treat their kind with disrespect as well. In the end I had more sympathy with the rich family than with any of those impostors. It wasn't a story about ""from dish washer to millionaire"". It was a story about an unlikable, criminal family that in the end had no redeeming factors at all."
4.5,2020.01.25,"Parasite is, if not the best, definitely one of the top 5 movies of 2019. The film is almost perfect in every aspect possible.

Both the cinematographer Kyung-pyo Hong and the director Bong Joon-ho make an outstanding job with a production design that is off the charts. These three aspects together result in one of the most eye-grabbing movies of the decade. Every shot is, at the same time, beautiful and meaningful, to the point that you could understand the whole movie even if it had no dialogues.

The screenplay is also one of the strengths of the film. Bong Joon-ho and Han Jin-won came up with a great idea that is as original as it gets and managed to make it funny, interesting, sarcastic, sad and verisimilar. The movie shows the difference between classes like ""Roma"" (2018), but has the rhythm and its core similar to ""Get Out!"" (2017).

Every character is important and has its moment of protagonism. Due to the complexity and the nuances put in the screenplay, none of the characters is a villain or a hero. The only villains in this story are the unfairness of the capitalistic society and the lack of empathy of wealthy people towards the less resourceful ones.

The acting by all the main cast is sublime, but the highlights are Kang-ho Song and Yeo-jeong Jo. Kang-ho plays Kim Ki-taek, father of the Kim family. He captures the essence of this experienced man that has gone through a lot in his life and has his pride taken from him in the course of the movie, making his character's arc of development the most interesting of the film. Yeo-jeong plays Yeon-gyo, mother of the Park family. She is the complete opposite of Ki-taek; she's naive and has, and seemingly has always had, an easy life. She's clearly not aware of the things that happen outside her bubble, and that makes her vulnerable to smart people like the Kim family.

Last, but definitely not least, the music. It dictates the current state of the film and manipulates the spectator so you get absolutely fixated on the screen. It has hints of suspense, comedy and even horror.

Parasite (2019) is one of the finest movies made in the past decade and, most certainly, deserves a watch. It's eye-grabbing in every sense of the word and really fun to watch, but is also very dense and insightful, providing a vision of how things work that's not usually shown in the mainstream content."
3.5,2020.02.01,"The movie was well written, well acted, well paced, well filmed, well scored. Everything was pretty good. For me, it is a far cry from the best film I've seen. It might not even be in the top 10. Don't get me wrong. It was a very good movie worth watching, and worth watching on the big screen. I don't really get the masterpiece and best film ever comments. It was entertaining and thought provoking. Go see it, but ignore the super reviews as well as the bad reviews."
0.5,2020.01.04,"Ridiculous, implausible plot; heavy handed allegory at best. Overdrawn caricatures of rich and poor. I guess some viewers found this funny, but nobody laughed in the theater. The worst was the gratuitous violence near the end, shown with graphic detail."
5.0,2020.02.09,"Everyone said ""Go see Parasite"". Everyone said ""The one rule about Parasite is that you don't talk about Parasite"". So I went to see Parasite. So this is a review about Parasite without talking about Parasite.

Kim Ki-Woo (Woo-sik Choi) is a student living with his family in poverty in a sub-basement room, sponging off internet signals and scrounging a living, of sorts, by assembling pizza boxes. Opportunity presents itself when his best friend, the slightly older Min (Seo-joon Park), goes abroad to study. For Min is an English tutor to the up-market Park family's school-age daughter Da-hye (Ji-so Jung). Not wanting his fellow 'frat-boys' to move in on future romance - he's lined up Ki-Woo as his replacement.

Ki-woo knows he's lucked in when he visits the swanky Park residence and manages to pull the wool over the eyes of Da-hye's not too bright mother Yeon-kyo (Yeo-jeong Jo). But the influence of the family's ""lucky rock"" doesn't stop there. Ki-woo sees an opportunity to get jobs for his sister Kim (So-dam Park), his father Ki-taek (Kang-ho Song) and his mother Chung-sook (Hye-jin Jang). And gradually the poor Kim family start to encroach on the rich Park family's lives.

You might think that's the story. It's not. Just when you think you know where the film is going - a gentle comic tale with farcical elements - the movie takes a sudden left turn into The Twilight Zone.

To say more, if you've not seen the film, would be cruelty beyond measure. It's a truly astonishing script, by writer/director Bong Joon Ho, and my nomination for the Oscar for best original screenplay.

It's the details that get to you. This will be a superb film to watch multiple times. There are fabulous details scattered throughout. You know how the more expensive the car the more ""solid"" the clunk is as you shut the door? Listen to the sound effect when the Park front door shuts! Look what happens to the ""one of a kind"" lucky rock!

As for one of my favourite films from last year - ""The Farewell"" - you very quickly get to accept and embrace the subtitles. YOU MUST NOT LET THIS PUT YOU OFF. This is a masterpiece of cinema, well-deserving of its multiple Oscar nominations and its Cannes Palme d'Or award. At 132 minutes, it's not a short film, but seldom have two hours flown by faster. It's totally gripping. At times hysterically funny; at times shocking. A class struggle movie of a calibre that Ken Loach would never have imagined!

Gripes? I had just one. An action near the end of the movie seems bizarrely out of character and was a ""WTF"" moment that I didn't think the film needed. However, it did set up a wonderful story-telling finale that I will think about for many months.

It provoked that seldom found reaction in the cinema when the end-titles ran. A hubbub of chatter and appreciation.

It comes with a highly recommended from me.

4.5,2020.02.11,"This is one of the best movies of the new century. All characters are real and to some extent relatable. While the movie is Korean and leverages Korean culture in many parts, the multicultural, universal takes what made this movie so great.

Most importantly, while the movie does make a lot of comments with regards to class differences, it constantly refrains from taking side or lecturing the audience."
4.5,2020.01.24,"It starts as a high quality comedy movie but things getting change. General look at Parasite, it's true to say that it's kind of horror movie couse' of the main idea. People like Kim family, lives in the real world society and doing ""parasiting"" to other people. This is one of the best movies in 2019 and director's best work after Snowpiercer."
5.0,2020.02.10,"I went into this movie without knowing anything about it. I had no expectations whatsoever but holy hell does it deliver. It is one of the best films I have ever seen. It's constantly evolving, never boring and so unpredictable. Bong Joon Ho is truly a genius and this is pure art. Everything about this film is perfect, there is not one thing I could name that i would change about it. It deserves all the praise it is getting. What a film."

,2020.08.15,"The film was ok, I think a LOT of people tried to read into it too much and find way too much symbolism. It was ok for a movie to watch when you can't find anything else."
3.5,2019.06.21,"9 star rating from YMS and a Palm d'Or. What have we here? A dark comedy from a great Korean director going back to his roots? Nois. I'll make sure I pay close attention to this one.

As expected, this film is good. However it could have easily been bad, if not for the brilliant cinematography, strong directorial sense, and most of all, thought provoking messages and philosophies that don't hold back at reflecting the brutal reality of class in our society. However, you aren't here to see me laud, you want to know why I don't hold it in as high regards as everyone else.

The film feels messy. Although the comedy is often effective, I don't think it fits well enough in this context. The story is innovative, though it does feel familiar in certain parts. The sudden mood changes aren't my cup of tea as well.

A lot of the plot points are just too over the top. They can be distracting. They can be too weird, especially regarding the climax/ending (you'll know what I mean). There are little bits of details that never got an answer till the end; or maybe I need more time to think about them, who knows. Lastly, the message is a little bit too obvious and shoehorned in.

It is hard to talk about the many aspects of the film without spoilers. At the end of the day I'll still highly recommend this film because, after all it is a good film, and supporting lesser known but highly acclaimed directors is always a good gesture. But I'm still in the process of figuring out why people love it so much. I guess I'm not too appreciative of Korean films considering my 7/10 rating for The Handmaiden, but this is open to change, and if you are willing to engage in well mannered discussion with me, I may learn to like it much more than I do."
5.0,2020.01.29,"Now THAT's how you make a movie! Kudos to the writer/director, cast and crew for making such a neo-classic work of art! If this movie doesn't win some Oscars, it'll be a crime against humanity!"
3.0,2022.08.14,"A hard up Korean family slyly manipulate themselves into different jobs working for one wealthy family.

The story takes an unexpected turn when a visitor arrives.

This movie received a lot of good hype and it makes a social commentary. It's very well made but ultimately I did not really like the whole story being told. Not sure I would recommend."
0.5,2020.02.19,"PARASITE (2019)

I watched Parasite out of curiousity after it won the Oscar. Well, I watched half of it and fast forwarded through part. The trailer repelled me, so I decided not to watch it before this point. The cinematography was wonderful, but once again, my view is in the minority in terms of public reaction to a popular film. I found the movie sadistic and disturbing. Rather than a provoking statement about class, I saw a dark, sick film laced with contempt, gratuitous violence, caricatures of people, and unlikeable characters with no moral compass. How utterly depressing."
5.0,2019.12.05,"This movie is great it's hilarious, gripping and intense the less you know before seeing it the better"
4.5,2020.01.18,"This movie is clever on so many levels, the acting is impeccable, the story-line unexpected and the directing flawless but I don't want to give too much away, just watch it. In this era of super heroes and sequels, this is a breath of fresh air and a sign that there's still hope for the craft."
5.0,2020.02.02,"Great, Masterpiece. This movie pictures how human, rich or poor, can do anyhing at any cost to earn what they wanted. But exclusively, this movie shows that even poor people can fool or at this point, ""PARASITE"" onto you, rich or poor. At first-half of the film, I could laugh. But at second-half ('til end), I get the moral lesson of the film."
5.0,2020.02.03,We should keep it in a time capsule for the future generations. This describes a whole era.

4.5,2020.02.01,"Epic tale of class distinctions in modern-day South Korea. Ironic, clever, and touching."
3.0,2024.08.19,"I've wanted to watch this for a while because of the high praise it has gotten. However, I think this made my experience worse. Because I had such high expectations, I felt a bit underwhelmed by this movie.

Personally, I thought the first hour was unimaginably boring. Supposedly this is part comedy? I don't know where the comedy part was to be honest.

The pace picked up in the second part, but I'm not sure if I liked this much better. Our main characters suddenly became so incompetent, it made the plot go into a bit of a weird direction.

I have a conflicted opinion on this. On one hand, I can tell this movie had some real skills behind it. The camera shots, the acting, the details. Everything was thought through and that was quite obvious. For example I did appreciate the progression towards the dad's breakdown. The way we get little details on mr. Park. Although nice at first, we get more clues on how he sees his staff as less than him. The way he held his nose as he picked up his keys.

Also, the very subtle hints at that the family is basically useless at everything, making you wonder who is really the parasite.

So I get it, the symbolisms, metaphors. The cinematography was skillful.

But if I think only 10% was wow-worthy, that doesn't make up for the other 90%. Maybe it needed that 90% for that 10%, but the 90% was just not enjoyable. If a movie is not enjoyable, it defeats the purpose of a movie. Movies can be an artform, but it's still supposed to give the watcher a good experience. In this case it just didn't give me that as much as I wanted it to."
5.0,2020.02.07,"Yesterday, at around the beginning of the third act, I 'came to' and realized that this film had hooked my complete attention; then, at the roll of the credits, I had so many thoughts that were provoked by nearly every shot of this movie-laughing and awe-struck by what I'd just experienced. It had been a long time since a movie had given this effect, and it's original films like this that come out of nowhere every once-in-awhile. And today, I know for sure I have to write down my thoughts about this new surprise hidden gem, Parasite, because it truly deserves to be called a masterpiece. This is my first, and most definitely not my last, foreign film to make this list of the greatest. I'm so thrilled that I was motivated to go see this as it has pushed my boundaries of what I thought makes a movie great. Bong Joon Ho has delivered a flawless comical satire that focuses on real issues of the divisions of social classes that are present in every society-so it is not just relatable to Koreans. The genres that can be attached to the movie are numerous since it has bits of comedy, drama, suspense and even thriller aspects that all perfectly interweave together to hold your focus until the very end. It is both moving and thought-provoking, but is also a movie I'd recommend to anyone at any age or stage in their life. It is an all-around masterful original piece of cinema which makes for a very fun time at the movies. Adding to the greatness of the film is the performances from the entire cast. A great ensemble of talented actors-including Ho's long time collaborator Kang-ho Song-make watching every character on screen a moment not to miss. When there is so much chemistry within an on-screen family, you know that the acting is superb to a point at which you forget you are watching a fictional story. You just sympathize with each character because you understand how their actions are driven. Intertextuality is big in this film and makes a second viewing necessary and welcomed. I could watch this movie over and over and find many more hidden aspects that further prove how much thought and time went into crafting it. Bong Joon Ho has my pick for directing and this film for best foreign, possibly best overall. Inspiring to both film enthusiasts and to the everyday human being-this one is very monumental to foreign cinema since it leaves you having a different perspective on the industry. It warns us not to overlook nor disregard a movie simply because we don't like reading subtitles. -TE (11.10.19)"
3.5,2024.06.02,"Reviewing this movie is a unique challenge for me. As a Japanese person, I've always had a special connection to Asian cinema, even if I haven't always been a fan of the style. My interest in Korean and Japanese movies is often driven by nostalgia rather than a refined taste for the acting and directing styles. It's not that these movies are bad, it's just that my preferences lean elsewhere.

However, there are exceptions. One Korean movie that truly left a mark on me is Oldboy. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to skip the Hollywood remake and dive straight into the original. This movie is a visceral experience that will leave you reeling.

The same feeling applies to Parasite. Again, I need to become more familiar with the director and actors. I went to the theater to watch this mainly because of the many praises, awards, and the surprising Oscar nomination for both the Best International Movie and Best Movie categories. Of course, I had to check it out.

When I first sat down to watch Parasite, I had no idea what to expect. The movie starts off like a slice-of-life soap opera, a slow burner that gradually builds tension. But as the story unfolds, the tension escalates, leading to a gripping climax that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

I can't speak too much, not to spoil the surprises and twists. And, oh boy, there are many twists to this plot. It's best to avoid reading anything about the story so you are surprised.

Overall, the directing is superb. The screenplay is not complicated, and it's very well written. The acting is also competent, mixing moments of comedy and tension very well. But, it feels ""dry,"" if it makes any sense.

This is definitely only a movie for some. And as I have minimal exposition to Korean filmmaking, I don't have many other references than Oldboy (and the rest of the Vengeance Trilogy movies, which I'm not too fond of so much). But Oldboy has such a visceral punch that it's hard to forget, even years after I watched it.

Parasite lacks this punch even though the kind of storytelling is similar in a way: a tragedy. Don't get me wrong; it's a very good movie to go see in the theaters. But IMHO, I don't know why this movie is Oscar material. Alas, yes, there are several other nominees, but I also don't understand why they are Oscar material.

From another perspective, for most of the movie, it reminded me of a Tarantino movie. Again, it still needs the punch. But it's textbook Tarantino through and through. The 2nd half is particularly striking and goes super deep into total madness. That's why you want to go to the theater to watch.

I gave Oldboy a very solid 8 out of 10, and I highly recommend you watch it. Parasite is a bit behind, and I think it deserves a solid 7 out of 10."
0.5,2020.02.12,"Worst movie by far I have ever watched. Plot is absolute crap, predictable and boring. How did this even got nominated...? How was this even released!??? I want to believe that all the people that voted 10 was only because it has won an Oscar and they blindly follow whatever gets a prize. Don't waste a single second of your life watching that."
5.0,2020.02.03,Not many movies combine entertainment and social commentary in equal measure but this one sure does. There are many layers to the plot; there's the events that you're watching but there's also a deeper layer that you're almost compelled to think about as you watch. Everyone will have a slightly different takeaway of what the filmmakers are trying to say but I think everyone will get something valuable from it. I would recommend 100 percent!
5.0,2020.02.04,Easily the best film of 2019. Potential winner of best movie at the Oscars!
4.5,2020.02.02,"Rooting for an impoverished but resourceful underdog struggling to make ends meet, sets up a standard feel good movie scenario. Seemingly innocuous, ""Parasite"" captures the lively trials of the Kim family as they scheme and trick their way into cushy employment, starting an invasion of sorts. The web of lies in an escalating con targeting the insensitive and gullible Park family opens a series of mouth watering doors, but alas, there's always some that should remain shut.

Whether it's borders, classes, or smells, everyone has a line, that once crossed, destroys most semblance of rationale. ""Parasite"" brilliantly dissects how these boundaries (however personal and subjective) are developed within our very complicated and unique species.

Filmed almost exclusively within the two families' domiciles, one a filthy, cramped basement apartment, the other a glorious, spacious and meticulously spotless mansion on the hill, ""Parasite"" offers an obvious and very deep class chasm as plot kindling.

Delicious absurdist touches like peach fuzz allergies, hammer throw expertise, American Indian infatuations, and wifi signal hunting, are peppered throughout offering much welcomed distraction. Spinning an endearing class dichotomy comedy wildly out of control adds white knuckle power to the jarring second act. Sides are drawn early on, making it is easy to cheer for the bottom feeders in this warfare, but not everything on screen is black and white. The consequence of action and reaction during the increasingly muddied grey areas powers this film. What is good? What is evil? How is that line drawn?

Sneaky, powerful, perfectly paced, funny, shocking, and quite wonderful. Can a film be both dark and bright? Yes, yes it can.

5.0,2020.02.02,"It's been a while since I watched a movie that made such impact on me. First of all, I really liked the story of different social classes, despair, greed, deception, pride and prejudices. It is masterfully directed by Bong, carefully navigating through a scenario full of twists and unexpected turns. Dialogues are funny and there is good characterization making characters complexed and intriguing. Parasite can't be categorized in a specific movie genre, rather it's a mix of dark comedy, drama and thriller which is it's strong feature because there are not so many movies who can balance so well between those genres. This is movie that I will gladly watch many times. A real gem of Korean cinematography."
4.0,2020.02.03,"I really enjoyed this film, because Bong Joon-Ho perfectly masters its original and impactful story of the underprivileged family who uses all the means at their disposal to rise in society although they are aware that there have no place. The best aspect of this film is that it takes no sides in the script. In addition, this film is wonderfully topical although it only briefly touches on subjects such as social networks, it does this very effectively by mixing Thriller and Comedy."
5.0,2020.02.01,"This film is extremely engaging and gripping. The way the film switches it's genre was marvelous. Direction, Story and Acting have been mastered. These films require their due recognition. Truly a masterpiece"
3.5,2019.11.22,"The movie was really good! It's worth watching! The struggle of classes and the gap between them is visible in this movie, but all is is dressed with a lot of humor, unexpected events and a storyline and plot that won't let you down or make you feel bored at any moment!"
4.5,2020.02.05,"A great movie. Not a dull moment. What a great script , acting and directing. Probably one of the most original and entertaining film I've seen in many years. A tragedy wrapt up in a comedy genre."
3.5,2020.04.11,Clever idea but ended up being farcical. Excellent acting and original plot however how it ended up into a murder spree is where it was let down.
0.5,2020.02.16,"I was excited to see Parasite, due to rave reviews, and it winning best picture. I was warned by a theater worker that ""the first half-hour is slow, but then it gets really good"". So I made it through the first half-hour, and kept waiting for the ""really good"" part, only to find out that it was the exact same; more tedium by a family that was not really likable. The violence was not necessary either, and seemed to be a way to make it Oscar worthy. A lot of Oscar nominated movies have violence at the end, and that seems to be a way to get more respect, or something. It was sad, and horrible, in my opinion. I cannot wrap my mind around the fact that this movie, compared to 1917, Little Women and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, won best picture! Honestly what is going on with those who vote, that vote for this drivel? It was okay, don't get me wrong, but that's all--merely okay. (For the record, I love movies with subtitles, and have seen several amazing ones, but this was not one of them.)"
4.5,2020.02.11,"Glad that I watched this movie before the Oscar nominees were announced. I feel a number of people Judge it harshly bcos it won a film over other equally excellent movies

In my opinion it's definitely one of the best movies of 2019-2020.

Excellent performances and a harsh view of people at the bottom

The movie switches very quickly from comedy to drama to violence near end.

Sad open ended finale.

Highly recommend"
4.0,2020.02.10,"Really good movie, well directed and played by actors, story is also Excellent, it's showing the reality of our society, and mental behavior of different people of different stage."
5.0,2020.02.03,"It is always exciting to see what the Frenchies decided was film of the year as it never fails to be a better pic than whatever the Hollywood menagerie showers with a critical accolades come Springtime. Little did I expect Cannes Film Festival to award the prestigious Palme D'or this year to a director who has been one of my least favorite filmmakers...until now. Bong Joon-ho's English film debut, 2013's SNOWPIERCER, struck me as overrated and dumb while 2017's OKJA was cartoonish and ham-fisted. It didn't help that he'd relegated two of my favorite actors, Tilda Swinton and Jake Gyllenhaal, to cringe-inducing career-low sideshow performers. Besides that, I just couldn't vibe with his grotesque and bumbling concoction of family-friendly cuteness, ultra violence, and quirky humor. It reeked of trying too hard and failed to land with me at every turn. With that said, let me be the first and most surprised person to say with no reservations PARASITE is easily one of the best movies I've seen this year. However, there's the other genetically engineered super pig in the room: PARASITE has an awful lot in common with last year's Palme D'or winner SHOPLIFTERS. Putting aside that the former is a Korean production and the latter was Japanese, both films follow the lives of a poor family as they struggle on the fringes of society, running cons and scams to get by in a callous world. They are held together by their honest love for one another, and their example is set juxtaposed to the neglectfulness of a consumerist society that allows so many to fall through the cracks in the first place. But the main way that Joon-ho one-up's his award-winning predecessor is with an incisive sense of humor suffused in each character, a humor that is immediately, physically translatable despite the language barrier. It works here so well precisely because it's reigned in and understated throughout the film, making the more manic parts hit harder - such as when Park So-Dam apathetically lights a cigarette on a lidded toilet spewing flooded sewage out the sides. The class conscious themes that have pervaded Joon-ho's science fiction offerings up to this point are given a much greater sense of immediacy and relatability as we watch this struggling family elbow their way into the good graces of a rich, privileged, and naive family. Beside the obvious ""haves vs. have-nots"" one would expect from this scenario, there's clearly an exploration of the structures that relegate people into servitude and poverty for generations, not just by the wealthy elite but by the pervasive mechanisms of misfortune that are maintained by the working class as we claw at each other's throats for short-term gain. Believe the hype, PARASITE is well deserving of the praise it has received thus far. It's tense, hilarious, and poignant, and I'm forced to genuinely re-evaluate this director's output knowing that he knocked it out of the park this time."
5.0,2020.02.04,"Like watching a Sergio Leone, this director is just a god in film making."
4.5,2020.02.05,Inspite of movie it was more of a experience and a great one.. So much genres in a single movie and all of them are completely justified with the characters and dialogues...
4.5,2020.02.05,"I've loved every film of Bong Joon Ho's that I've scene dating back to the Host. One of the premier auteurs of our generation. This film did what so few films do in our current era, it genuinely surprised. The film is as authentically original and inspired as people are saying it is.

Loved it."
3.5,2019.10.27,"For shure it's a good movie. The production is great ( visual, audio, cut). But the story started great and end up a little flat. Also the critic about capitalism could be sharper."
5.0,2020.02.04,"One of the best movies i've ever seen. This movie is full of wonderful surprises. The scene where the sister sits on the toilet on her phone as it's overflowing was really striking and perfectly juxtaposed her true circumstances and the life she lived in Mr Parks house. Also the scene where the old housekeeper is attempting to push the shelves out of the way was striking and really unexpected whilst being satirical(laughed out loud). I have to say the house having a basement where her husband lived was the most shocked and surprised ive been in a while from a movie.It also works in a metaphorical sense to portray how although on the surface everything seems very normal in the house much like how the family seems to be regular people working for the Park family although they are deceiving them. The whole movie took me by surprise and I didn't see any of it coming; it's really clever. I laughed out loud many times sometimes feeling somewhat guilty for having done so. The director and everyone in the movie and involved deserve major praise for pulling it off. I also have to admit I was somewhat shocked that the son survived as it appeared he had bled out, i guess they were again playing on the idea of things not being as they seemed. It's a great movie in the sense that it explores deep subjects such as inequality, meritocracy, social class heirarchy ignorance but what makes it great is that you don't have to notice or connect to any of those themes what so ever to truly enjoy the movie, this movie is for everyone. Satirical, metaphorical, genius, paradoxical, impulsive, genuine; watch this movie!!!!"
,2019.09.30,"This is one of those movies from a director who has done some interesting movies before, which gets a gigantically good rating and seems the overall most well-produced, but is on the whole boring or insufferable, even while at times amusing or properly ""tragic"". The story has elements of crude metaphor, of course, and shows characters, who at first seemed to behave with magical skill, later behave pointlessly and foolishly to get to a dramatic enough finale."
3.0,2020.02.14,"Fairly well told story of struggles, hardships and fantasies of south korean lower middle class. Draws some pertinent inferences to cruel class differences capitalism creates and flourishes upon. Attention to details and proximity to reality remains comendable for the first couple of hours and then comes the disastrous climax. The irrational, abrupt, unjustified and plot defying actions of the characters in the dramatic last scene will surely spoil the mood. The climax will also reveal grave weaknesses of the plot which cant help leading to an inevitable low key ending."
2.5,2020.02.28,"Not sure why its hyped so much. Its a normal movie, not so great and definately not oscar worthy. Jojo rabbit is far better. I watched it after all the hype and i was dissapointed."
4.0,2020.02.09,"The plot starts as a comedy by taking advantage of a gullible rich lady and slowly creeps into the harsh truth of haves and have not. The climax leaves a strange impact on - ""Is it even possible to attain the status of a good earning life style for such a family in honest ways?"". One of the masterpiece from Korean films. A worthy watch that keeps you entertained!!"
5.0,2020.02.08,"What is Parasite - A Satire? Sarcasm, humor, emotion, human condition, suspense, thriller, social issues, drama, thought provoking dialogues, strong and smooth acting - all ingredients cooked with utmost perfection and balance and served with elegance and style.

It is an unconventional storytelling, it may look very simple and everyone might watch and love this film but it has layers of strong and complex structure and an extraordinary artistic flavor. The beauty of cinema lies in its frame, because that's the window through which we watch and experience the story. And that's where comes the cinematography and the production design, it has a rich and subtle tone with detail level precision , every frame, every shot is unforgettable. Another unconventional part of this movie is it's background score, we hear operatic music during a slow motion chaos. May be the background score is inspired from Hitchcock movies.

This film and the characters do not leave you after you finish watching, it stays with you, even if you want you can't escape from them, then slowly you learn to live with them in your head, because you are also one of them. It is a hypnotic movie which is disturbing but you will still want to watch it again and again, probably because you want to laugh, cry and get scared - all at the same time.

Parasite touches so many corners of human emotions without trying too hard to over amplify any scene or sequence. Kudos to Director Bong Joon-ho for his visionary approach to tell a story which is not unknown to anyone, forcing us to believe that we are very much part of this cruel world."
5.0,2020.02.04,"Bong Joon-ho is a South Korean filmmaker with a very diverse filmography and one who brings a distinct reputation with him when releasing a film, the Bong Hive being the name of his devoted fanbase. His latest film, Parasite, gets a long awaited release in the UK and going into this one blind is one of the best decisions you could ever make.

All unemployed, Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family take peculiar interest in the wealthy and glamorous Parks, as they ingratiate themselves into their lives and get entangled in an unexpected incident.

Parasite is an absolute triumph from Bong Joon-ho, his film building and building to a crescendo that I didn't see coming at all. It's a brilliantly written film, the humour running through the social commentary of class separation often genius throughout and the dark humour that takes things to the next level utterly breathtaking. There's a real intricacy to the screenplay, co-written by Bong and Han Jin-won, taking time to introduce us to the characters in such a way it makes what unfolds even more hard-hitting.

It isn't just the screenplay that deserves special mention for its intricacy, the production design on Parasite providing a stunning backdrop for the narrative to unfold. The time and effort that goes into making something as wonderful as the Park's family home always amazes me and it pays off majorly with its maze-like features almost serving as a character itself. Hong Kyung-pyo's sweeping cinematography through the narrow corridors and lower-class neighbourhood where the Kims actually live is beautifully neat and Yang Jin-mo's score accompanies the film with a wonderfully symphonic prowess.

Coming to the performances, Parasite is full of great performances from a cast who have been nothing but infectious this awards season. It's very much an ensemble piece, each of them getting their moment to showcase their talents but the stand-outs for me were Song Kang-ho, Park So-dam and Cho Yeo-jeong.

Parasite is Bong Joon-ho's magnum opus and has set an incredibly high bar for the rest of 2020 in film to live up to. I haven't been as fully engrossed in a film as I was watching this masterpiece unfold and I can only imagine it's going to get better with each viewing."
5.0,2020.02.03,"PARASITE impressed me enough that I wanted to see it again. Having done so, I've increased my initial 9 rating to a full 10.

What I thought were plot holes turned out to have simple explanations that I had missed in my initial viewing. And with the element of surprise gone, I could more fully concentrate on the characters and their motives. I especially liked that no one here is 100% blameless or 100% evil. That kind of moral ambiguity is common in everyday life. I only wish it were more common in movies.

This time, I also paid much closer attention to the film's abundant symbolism. Admittedly, though, I still couldn't figure out the significance of the Scholar's Rock. But that says more about me than it does about this magnificently brilliant film.

If not the for THE IRISHMAN, I would root for PARASITE as this year's Best Picture winner. Still, it's a shoo-in for Best Foreign Language Film."
4.0,2020.01.16,"From my exposure to Korean Drama/Horror I know that something at some point will go horribly wrong and the end there is no happy end for nobody. And yet this was so unexpected when I watch this movie. Great drama, 8/10."
4.0,2020.01.26,"This film's ranking here on IMDb is somewhat of an anomaly. Usually, when a hot new release makes it's way into the Top 250, it manages to remain in it's general range for a while and then slowly decline as more and more reviewers add their vote. ""Parasite"" entered the list in the mid Fifties if I correctly recall, and since then has managed to improve it's position to #26 as I write this. No one knows if that will hold obviously, so I'm curious to see how the movie rates over time.

Having stated that, I thought the film was brilliant in the way it opened and had the Kim family maneuver it's way into the life and home of the Park family. What was questionable to me was why the Kim's weren't able to improve their condition in life prior to the break they received when Min (Seo-joon Park) suggested the tutoring job to Ki-woo (Woo-sik Choi). Each of the Kim's demonstrated a cleverness and facility at their respective talent in such a way that none of them should have remained unemployed for very long. It's not sufficient or accurate to say that they were lazy or lacked ambition, because once that ambition kicked into gear, there was no stopping them from infiltrating into the lives of the Park's. Not that it wasn't done by underhanded or devious means, but with those kinds of street smarts, they should never have been living in a ghetto neighborhood. But that was the set up, so you have to go with it.

Where the story begins to go off the rails is when the Kim's luxuriate in their new surroundings and throw caution to the wind so to speak. Personally, I would never have allowed the former housekeeper Moon-gwang (Jeong-eun Lee) unescorted access to the Park home when she came calling to rescue her husband. Though it revealed the hidden areas of the Park home, they would have been discovered by the Kim's had they followed and observed Moon-gwang to begin with. Instead, the lapse in judgment allowed for a potential escape and as it turned out, a blackmail attempt that would have fired all the Kim's from their lucrative positions.

I have to admit, I was somewhat baffled by Mr. Kim's (Kang-ho Song) stabbing of Park Dong-ik (Sun-kyun Lee), but reading some of the more thoughtful reviews here helped put that into perspective. I can't say that I agree wholeheartedly, but at least the reasons offer some semblance of a motive, all revolving around the idea of 'crossing the line' that the Kim's were guilty of. Even so, by giving the story a Tarantino-esque spin for it's denouement was going more than a bit over the top. And to venture even further into the realm of unreality, Ki-woo's survival after getting smacked in the head by a twenty pound landscape stone, not once but twice!, was entirely incomprehensible to this viewer.

As for the ultimate finale, who's to say that Kim-woo's plan to rescue his dad wasn't a viable one - grow up, get rich and buy the house! Good luck with that idea, because in the very words of Mr. Kim himself - """"If you make a plan, life never works out that way"". And on top of that, it would be a decade long mission at the very least. In the final analysis, if the story had kept on track with the devious infiltration into the lives of the Park's, I could envision a scenario in which the parasites might have eventually dominated their hosts in their own home. But it didn't turn out that way, and as a result, I think it misses the mark as the year's Best Picture at the Oscars.

Addendum**** 2-10-2020 - Well, I'm not embarrassed to admit I was wrong about the picture's chances at the Oscars. It won 'Best Picture' last night in a pretty competitive field. Congratulations!"
3.5,2020.09.13,"This movie is moderately good. I can't believe how it won Oscars. It won even feature in that top 20-30 movies I have seen. There is too much hype around it. I have watched much better movies both Western and Indian which portrays raw class, caste, religious and gender divide."
4.5,2019.06.02,"Bong Joon-ho's Parasite is perfectly written, filmed, and played - a bit too much at times (did we need this Ri Chun-hee's impersonation, or was that a bonus for Western audiences?).

No spoilers, but you're forced to understand the gimchi will somehow hit the fan, to want to know, among all possible worst case scenarios, which one will prevail, and to enjoy the ever darker humor first permeating, then overflowing this over the top gem.

If this brilliant epic echoes Im Sang-soo's 'The Housemaid' & Kim Ki-duk's '3 iron', Bong remains a league of his own."
3.5,2020.04.10,"Although I enjoyed watching the movie, I don't understand why people say this is one of the best movies of the decade. The ending is kinda weird and the middle of the movie is also boring"
0.5,2019.12.07,I was so curious to download this film ever since i read the reviews which are mostly positive. Turns out Parasite is just another predictable story that didnt put me on the edge of the seat as it was promised. I am seriously shocked Cannes chose this film to be its winner for 2019
5.0,2019.10.27,"So, you think you're going to ""fast track"" your way to the good life huh? By taking a short cut here, a little lying and deceiving there.

Well maybe.. it seems to work for some, why not for you? (I mean how else did they get there, right? By being honest? ..oh please!)

So you decide to take the ""easy"" road. One lie opens one door, then another, and yet another.

Things seem to be going so well for you. You're getting ahead without having to make any real sacrifices. All of this unearned wealth is just within your reach.

But one night...

~~~~~LIGHTNING! ~~~ THUNDER! ~~~~~

...comes a flood.

And the entire foundation your life is built on, washes away.

Turns out all those lies, short cuts, and easy way outs were not good building material.

You had the wrong plan. You walked the wrong path. And you made the wrong sacrifices.

You thought you were taking the easy way out, the short cut.

Look at how wrong you were.

In the end, you lost everything: Your sister. Your father. Your home. Your freedom. Your health.

Tell me again how this was suppose to be the easy way out?

My god... would it not have been easier to have made the proper sacrifices right from the start?

I guess we all have to learn are lessons somehow.

So today I have a new plan. I will go to university, study, graduate. I will get a job and work very hard. I will become rich. And I will get back the house. And one day, you will walk out of the basement father, and we all be reunited in the sunshine of the courtyard.

Until then."
5.0,2019.10.17,"This film goes places where few dare to wonder. It begins as a dark, hilarious comedy but evolves into a startling, violent climex I will never forget. Everything about the film is exceptional. It is a true masterpiece."
5.0,2019.09.01,"High-quality toy tent which does not get wet with rain, and odd contrast of furniture which does not get wet by rain"
4.0,2020.01.22,"When it comes to foreign films I tend to be a little biased or lenient. They are such a welcome break from traditional Hollywood. When I see a decent foreign film I can't help but want to praise it more because they don't have the multi-billion dollar Hollywood machine behind them. Usually, they have to be more creative, more ingenious, and more resourceful.

""Parasite"" is one of very few Korean films I've watched in my life. My foreign film bank consists mostly of Chinese kung-fu movies of which Jackie Chan and Jet Li probably occupy the most space. Korean films are a rarity for me. This suspenseful thriller by Bong Joon-Ho deserves all of the accolades it has received.

What I knew about it going in was that a poor family had moved in on a wealthy family to take advantage of them. That is essentially what happened, but you're not holding anyone's attention with that concept alone. Each character in this film had something to offer and was watchable. As the movie developed and we saw the Kim family sinking its teeth deeper into the Park family, we were treated with wonderful dialogue and a crafty script.

How do you make a movie in which none of the characters are antagonists and none are really protagonists either? Some how ""Parasite"" did that. The Kim family certainly was shady and underhanded, but they could be viewed as a poor family just trying to get ahead. The Park family was wealthy, yet unlike your average rich movie family, they were not cruel or unbearable people. In fact they were very likeable.

Normally, we want our clear-cut good guys and bad guys. We want our good guys to win and our bad guys to lose. In the cases where all of our guys are good, we want them all to win. In the cases where all our guys are bad, we want them all to lose. In ""Parasite"" not everyone is distinctly good or bad and there are really no winners."
5.0,2019.08.12,"This movie, starting as a clever comedy turns into a deep drama in a modern context of social inequities. This movie undelines how social classes remain splitted in today's world (almost as spltited as in Gosford Park). It also questions how the poor working class have to struggle against itself to benefit from the little that can runoff from the rich ones. Great actor playing and the right pace in the movie makes it a fantastic experience."
5.0,2019.08.20,"The Parasite is nothing short of masterpiece, proof that asian directors are one of best in the world. It is also well acted. All actors did amazing job. The main theme is social classes. Some scenes, especially the evening when it rained, were devastating. But beside that I found family relationships to be very good represented."
3.5,2020.04.04,Its a very good movie thats it. but very overrated.
5.0,2019.12.30,"Easily, one of the best movies of the year, because of many aspects: First, the acting is awesome, really strong performances by everyone. Second, the story is very interesting. And last but not least, the sequence of events in this movie is one if the year's best. I mean, every act is great on its own, but if you put them all together, you will witness a Masterpiece, and if you watch any of them by itself, you will get an amazing short-film. Considering thd Oscars, this one is a strong nomination for Best Foreign Language Picture and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets a nomination for The Best Picture award."
3.5,2020.02.14,"The scene where the old maid arrives in the video at the door after the doorbell ring was so creepy, and I loved the scene where the family is getting drunk and talking around the table after dinner. The montage with the peach was also masterful, as was the way many scenes were filmed, styled, and handled. I loved how the old maid also got them on cell phone video proving they were all a family and knew each other and then blackmailed them (temporarily).

The young Kim family sister is an extremely talented actress, and so is the Parks pampered wife. The other actors were all solid as well. The story is universal and pop cultured so it is relevant and easy to follow for all languages and nationalities.

The movie is never uninteresting. Even when it slows down a little in its final half hour or so, it remains intriguing, but this is the only part that I felt that could have been a little bit better. I also had some questions about the incident at the Parks outdoor birthday party regarding why something happened the way it did.

The suspense really worked also outside of the mentioned scenes, and the humor was usually landing. The artsy shots and creative decisions all worked within the story. This is a solid movie for 2019 and deserves the Oscars."
1.5,2020.04.17,"Really, one of the worst, most drawn out films I've ever seen. The people touting it as a 10 are pseudo-intellectuals trying to construct something that just wasn't there - like the amateur critics on here who think of themselves as legit film critics. I'm sorry, the film just doesn't deserve the hype or accolades, and most certainly not the Academy Award (even for foreign language film, let alone Best Film).

I was expecting something deeply profound and artistic, and this just wasn't either of those things. This is a horrible example of trying to expand one's cinematic palate to foreign films, because there are wonderful foreign films out there. I'm guessing the people that liked this also thought ""Mother"" was some sort of mind blowing masterpiece."
5.0,2019.10.21,"Parasite is one of those movies were you can sit down and let it surprise you. The script reminds me of Billy Wilder. It switches from comedy to drama because life is like that. The directing is flawless, Acting is compelling. But the most important thing is how it illustrates the sad society we've come to create in the XXI century, with no social mobility. It is fatalistic because bettering yourself nowadays is practically impossible.

This film must be seen by anyone who loves movies. It is one that will stand the test of time. Hollywood be worried with your generic formulas, Korea is the new power house and Parasite is the culminations of years of doing things right. American audiences should read subtitles for once. This movie will make you laugh and cry. The story falls into place like this perfect unpredictable puzzle. It's a must watch. A masterpiece."
5.0,2020.01.26,"Bong Joon-Ho is a director that I'll definitely check out more. I loved Snowpiercer but have left to see the rest of his Korean films which have been unanimously praised by everyone. Parasite is nothing short of genius.

It's best to go in not knowing anything about the movie as that makes the experience all the more enjoyable but what I can say is that Parasite combines many different genres at once which is executed in the best way possible. This film will take you on a rollercoaster of emotions. There are some extremely funny moments then there are moments of tragedy and despair and then there are times which are incredibly intense yet none of it feels inconsistent. Bong Joon-Ho managed to find the perfect blend of funny and serious tones whilst making the film feel as smooth as possible.

The story of Parasite is extremely well thought and manages to stay subtle throughout its entirety. Bong Joon-Ho crafted characters that are really clever and interesting to watch. Their motivations and state make them believable to the audience. The events that unfold don't come across as unrealistic but rather plausible due to the excellent writing.

Aside from the story, this is one of the most beautiful films of 2019. The colours and lighting are really well utilised making the cinematography look downright gorgeous. There is one scene involving a lot of water which looks fantastic. The editing is fantastic as the film's pacing is quite fast so there is no dull moment whatsoever. The aesthetics on the whole is top notch.

I thought Knives Out had a stellar cast but the ensemble cast of Parasite is extraordinary. Everyone did a phenomenal job playing their roles.

I really tried to think of flaws but as of now I could not find any. Everything is addressed properly and what takes place all makes sense. Whilst delivering a fun film, there are some great themes and messages this film explores and Bong Joon-Ho sheds light on them visually rather than using exposition which I commend. I love how he respects the audience by not thinking they're dumb.

2019 has been one of the best years for film and Parasite is one of the best without a doubt. A lot of people have already seen this movie but if you haven't then go watch it immediately. This is a film you should not miss."
5.0,2020.01.20,"I find a lot of korean movies slow and unsatisfying but this one wasn't any of these things, neither did it have that annoying american touch, but this movie will suprise you in ways you would never expect!"
5.0,2019.12.29,This movie only describes how good to be a writer and how good to direct such type of movies. Best movie ever created 2019 I think and by far from the closest chaser.
5.0,2019.11.17,"There have been a sparse few films in recent years that have melded genres seamlessly, performed at the absolute top of their game in technical craft, offered a scathing sociopolitical commentary, all while telling an airtight and compelling story. Luckily for us, Parasite (Gisaengchung) checks all of these boxes, in a year where we couldn't have needed it more badly. Bong Joon-ho's latest absolutely blows all else out of the water (at least compared to the other 30+ movies I've seen in theaters this year), and in a highly organic and original way. The issue of class and the struggles of the poor climbing the ladder to become wealthy is one that Bong Joon-ho is well-known for using, for instance in 2013's Snowpiercer, yet Parasite never at any point feels like it borrows from any of its predecessors or overlaps with them in any way. This is the film's greatest strength, in my opinion, that it so flawlessly weaves together all of its components, including an interesting and nuanced take on class-structure, originally and in such a way that it feels perfectly natural for the story being told. The same can be said for how Bong traverses from one genre to another. From minute to minute, Parasite will have you laughing uproariously, and then suddenly, have you dead-silent and on the edge of your seat. The comedy is dark and laugh-out-loud, while the suspense will make you want to lean in, if only to try and pull the characters out of the scene, so as to relieve the tension. It should be no surprise, that everything else also falls into place wonderfully, from the poignant performances, to the razor sharp editing, to the stunning cinematography. In a year with both high-budget and indie takes on class-struggle such as Joker and Us, Parasite still manages to stand out, in a class of its own."
4.5,2020.01.18,You'll watch knowing you're in the hands of a master filmmaker
3.0,2022.07.20,"Finally got around to watching this movie, even though being a long time Korean movie fan.

Unsure how this won an Oscar and has such a high rating. Thought the same with Spirited Away, appears that these movies won Oscars for being different to the Hollywood norm, I think so anyway.

It was a fun watch, but not the best of movies like others would suggest. If you have seen many Korean movies before, you will understand that they don't follow the typical Hollywood formula. Watching this is nothing new and there are far better examples of amazing Korean movies.

Overall, this is worth a watch for sure, but it isn't the best of any genre IMHO."
5.0,2020.01.08,"If you like cinema, dont miss this movie.

At last, ill been waiting so many years for a movie like this: a beautiful, powerful and great history who touch all the film genres, and do it SO well. Parasite is an awesone thriller who break with a lot of spin and turns a masterpiece script.

A director in state of grace talks about almost everything: the most inhuman capitalism, how the middle class just dissapear, an amazing tale about the life and death, about the dreams that grow and dies, about you cant runaway for who you really are, and the great hole between the human being.

Is better just go and see this movie with no idea about what it goes. Its the greatest film you see for decades. Believe me. ""Dont do any plans. Life dont go this way"""
3.5,2021.03.05,"Good show, fun ride, quite fresh, definitely not overdone. But at a 8.6 rating, the community is saying it's better than The Green Mile, Whiplash, Interstellar, Gladiator and Terminator 2. I personally do not think it's on that level yet. Maybe its score has to do with how all the indian shows are highly rated on here."
2.5,2020.03.18,With all the hype around this film and winning the most prestigious award in film with the Oscar for best Picture I was expecting a lot more out of this movie. The story is great with a broke family hustling themselves into working for a rich family in Korea one job at a time was pretty good but the acting was very cartoonish to me. There's a lot of dialogue in this movie and sure it is a well-written script but these actors seem to just be reading the lines a lot of the time and not using their body language to really express the characters as much as I'm accustomed to through American film. I'm very disappointed in this movie and completely shocked that it won best picture. Surely there has to have been a better film made in 2019 than this? I give it 5/10
4.5,2020.01.13,"This film is always one step ahead of its audience. You are so in tune with the protagonists that by the time they are neck deep into their futile grift, the question of who's right or who's wrong isn't so much as being poised by the master director Bong Joon-ho; it's being slammed over your head with a rock. And when you recover, and the audience claps, the answer still isn't clear.

Parasite is deserving of all the massive praise it has received. That I saw this in a packed theater with an adoring, fully rapt crowd truly warmed my heart. It's cinema at its best.

As many folks are noting, and I will reiterate: go into this cold! Read as little about it as possible if you can. It will make the experience so much better. This is one I know I will be revisiting often over the years. Enjoy it."
4.5,2020.01.16,"Watching a movie in another language sometimes creates a barrier, but great film making and writing can instead, turn that into a bridge, and such is one of Parasite's strengths. I never felt out of touch with what was going on because I didn't understand that culture or anything along those lines, and that's why I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Parasite also has many outstanding shots and high level filmmaking in general. Visuals never dissapoint. The movie is so well paced and gets pretty wild toward the end without being ridiculous. The twists and turns it made were one of the most entertaining Ive seen in a while. There isn't much else to disect. Just go watch it."
5.0,2020.01.09,So finally I found a movie to write about and guess what I'm short of a word just Go and watch it it's truly a masterpiece
5.0,2020.01.03,"PROS:

EVERY SINGLE THING.

The acting is great. The pacing is amazing, it always feels like something is happening and you won't get bored. The message isn't scream out at the audience, you need to read between the lines. The characters are well developed, there's no hero or villain. You can empathize with every character and understand why they do what they do. There are violence, comedy, action, suspense and romance. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much, and I find myself really.

CONS:

Not for me, but some people may find the ending really weird and unsatisfying. But read some reviews and probably you would understand what's the message behind the ending."
5.0,2019.09.26,"So just lemme give a short review about points that make Parasite the best movie of the year or maybe the century:

1- It's a literal Dark Comedy movie although it discusses a non sensitive concept that's actually thrown every where on media

2- the economic gab wasn't about the evil rich or the fighting poors and has nothing with specific country u politics/economy

3- the balance between reality and fiction that makes ur mind wonder instead of watching the same senario

4- ""best plans are those never existed""

5-no one of the poor blamed anyone for being like that or even wondered what if

6- the end show the human's priority for 'survival'"
5.0,2020.01.05,"This is one of the greatest thing ever produced for a long time and most importantly ,Fresh. Unpredictable,mysterious and comedic so many feelings at the same time. Just watch and experience yourself if haven't already."
3.5,2021.02.15,"Had to see what everyone was raving about and that it won best picture. Started ok but became tedious very quickly. No subplots, gave impression of gullible rich. Lacking imagination and poor ending. Yep it was okish"
5.0,2019.12.09,"Bong Joon Ho has an amazing track record. Memories of Murder, Mother, and the Host are fantastic, Okja was awesome and Snowpiercer is good. He's never made a bad movie and with now seeing Parasite twice, I can say he's still going strong. Moreover this might be his best film or at least competes with it (Memories of Murder is still a considerable contender.) The madman went as far as I say, to making the second best movie of the year, only behind the Lighthouse for me. But for everyone else it's their number one and deservedly so. It's just one of those masterpieces everyone and anyone can enjoy, critic and casual viewer alike. The end strikes with blunt surprise and it was nice to gauge the theaters reaction after knowing what was going to happen. Bongs drama and comedy have always meshed so well together without bringing the tension out the scene but with this movie there's that and this amazing tone shift near the midpoint that fits like a puzzle piece; changing the atmosphere, themes, and style in a way that makes 100% sense. It's like many movies in one. This will be talked about as being a classic of the decade for these reasons because of how perfectly it was done.

Without spoiling too much, this movie is about class. And not in the obnoxious in-your-face way where the poorer characters can do no wrong and there's an obvious message of ""rich bad, poor sad"" but done in the way by subverting those tropes by making the poor flawed but smart and the rich into gullible people. Themes and messages the movie has are very subtle to being said out loud: that being mostly about exploring the ""line"" between class. Whether that be through extremely great writing or literally through the directing and how it's shot. The whole film is like this where a line in the shot separates the two classes. It's done through lines in the wall, one genius moment of a reflection on a window as it's being looked out of, a fridge, or just as simple as panning down like in the beginning to show they're the lowest of the low in a already low shot. How they view the same things such as rain tells a whole lot too. While the rich enjoy its beauty and smell, the poor despise it because it floods the neighborhood and house in a very tense dramatic scene. Another nice touch is where they're located: the poorer family living at the bottom of the hill get the brute end of the storm while the rich on top are unaffected. But how the poor view and react to other fellow poor people in a twist situation was the point where I knew this movie was genius. Rather than live together, they fight, accomplishing nothing but a good time for the audience.

The performances are memorable and witty and not one dimensional, each with a purpose and each one being immensely entertaining in their own way. They all had a time to shine and they did with flying colors. Bongs directing prowess is at an all time high as every frame and movement feels methodically thought out. His gorgeous use of cinematography, seamless editing, and music fits so well and help flesh out the soothing, chaotic, and claustrophobic atmosphere/tone. The set design was also noticeably pleasing as it explores into the themes more. I would give my interpretation on the rock but that would spoil it. I have nothing more to say other than don't read much else about it and go in blind if you can. 10/10"
3.5,2020.03.19,"This doesn't seem like an oscar - winning picture. There is no doubt of the good acting delivered by the actors ; each characters has its own personality and the plot is twisting enough. The whole story is quite metaphoric,hinting the notion of class struggle. However , in my opinion I think the metaphors are too explicit and at the same time can be disturbing. It just ain't oscar- wrothy!"
0.5,2020.02.27,"Anyone that thinks this movie is a masterpiece, is incredibly dim-witted. I'll be explaining why this is factual and listing all the silly things done by the main cast.

1. Infiltrating your entire family into the rich family's house.

They say it's hard to cover up one lie. You know what's harder? Covering up a whole lot of them and that's what the main cast foolishly tried to do on a daily basis constantly. All 4 family members had to fake their identity/qualifications, pretending to not be related to one another when they are, while they literally work together on a daily basis and expect to never slip up. The Kim family was dumb enough to think it was a good idea and foolish enough to think they would not be exposed in time.

2. Kevin's best friend problem

Your best friend has gave you an opportunity, to earn some cash, to replace him as a private tutor while he goes abroad. He also tells you that he's coming back and will ask the rich's family daughter out who he was tutoring. He has specifically told you that he's interested in her. He also explained that he has personally approached you specifically because he trusted you over his university friends who he finds revolting at the thought slavering over her, because he knows they would have ill intentions and trusted that you wouldn't.

What do you think would happen, when your best friend returns. When he comes back to find out he has lost his job, had his girl stolen right under his nose by his ""best friend"", and also finds out the ""best friend"" he confided in, who has broken your utmost trust, had his entire family infiltrated the rich man's family, working under false pretenses.

A: Is he going to shake your hand and congratulate you? B: Expose you and your entire family?

Apparently Kevin must have thought the answer must be A.

Anyone care to tell me? The answer is B! They would be exposed! Who would have thought about that right!?

3. Dining in the rich man's house like you own the place

Also, with your whole family without a care in the world. Yeah, let us make a mess of this table, get the wine, get the snacks, let's leave a it load of evidences that we had a party here! Oh crap, the rich man family is coming back? Help! I left so much mess here, what do I do now?

4. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. Fool me thrice, guess I'm going to die.

Kevin, why are you such a fool? Your first mistake was not having the foresight with your best friend problem. Second mistake was exposing your entire family and being held hostage by the hostages you were supposed to hold hostage.

Third mistake, the most fatal mistake of them all, why did even go back into the basement? You had both of them trapped under. There was no reason to go back. You wanted to redeem yourself? What did you want to do? Kill them? To silence them forever? Well, you failed miserably, caused the death of your sister and almost got yourself killed. I mean, of all things, you brought a rock, you even dropped that rock. C'mon. There's only so much incompetence I can tolerate from one character.

I could go on and on. The rock and its supposed ""symbolism"" that doesn't exist. How the ending went down, the absurd morse code. But I'm tired, tired of people over glorifying, thinking this is masterpiece when it isn't, of people explaining the ""hidden meaning"" of symbolism in different scenes that doesn't exist. Like how going up the stars means ascending in social status, how Jessica sits on sofa because she had a higher social status. How the toilet being the highest point in the house is supposedly a symbolism.

All in all, I don't actually think the movie was all that bad. But grossly overrated. Definitely not deserving of any Oscars that it has.

If you think otherwise, you've been factually proven wrong."
