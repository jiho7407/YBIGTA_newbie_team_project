4,2026.01.20,"good twist, however the first half dragged on."
5,2026.01.17,Foot on the gas from start to finish. Even with subtitles this movie kills it. The climactic ending is one of one.
4.5,2026.01.15,"Parasite leaves you with the feeling of having seen something truly different. It starts almost like a game, lowers your guard, and gradually pulls you into something far darker. One of its greatest strengths is how effortlessly it blends tones: black comedy, social satire and rising tension coexist without ever feeling forced. The film’s use of space and visual contrasts adds as much meaning as the dialogue, giving every scene a precise but never cold clarity. Bong Joon-ho observes rather than judges, letting the story speak for itself while pressing exactly where it hurts most. It’s smart, sharp, uncomfortable and deeply entertaining. Not quite perfect, but very close."
4,2026.01.14,8.5/10
5,2026.01.12,An example of a perfect film.
5,2026.01.11,"Is an absolute must-see. True, harsh, it hits you right in the face. This movie explains and makes you understand so many sad existing realities of our world"
5,2026.01.09,Timeless. A tasteful inspiration.
5,2026.01.04,"THE GOOD: At face value, the drama is very cartoony and almost sit com like. It's entertaining, sure, but it's not what makes this movie so good. What makes it so good is the layered messaging/symbolism hidden in so many scenes about classism. Acting is superb. cinematography is great. The twists and turns are all enticing and make you want to keep watching. The director teases so many different directions the movie COULD take. It's done masterfully to keep you engaged and on your toes the entire time. THE BAD: Some of the scenes are a little bit too cartoony/ridiculous for my liking. The father dragging himself across the room just looked bad. He clearly did it for the suspense and drama but for me it just landed flat. The other bad thing about this movie is that it's not for everyone. It's a thinker movie. That's why it's not super mainstream. It doesn't take away from the movie but it's definitely a downside. This is not a movie you turn on to be brainlessly entertained."
5,2026.01.04,"I didn't watch this film until well after it dominated at the Academy Awards. Much to my pleasant surprise, it absolutely lived up to its reputation. Simply incredible and engaging."
1.5,2026.01.03,Watched it because I saw it recommended on a horror site I follow. It was definitely not horror in any way. Really disappointed.
1,2025.12.28,Way over rated. horrible acting and fake blood. not worth it.
5,2025.12.28,"Yes, you have to watch subtitles. It's worth it: Smart, funny and poignant plot. And, as an added bonus, gives you some insight into South Korean culture."
0.5,2025.12.27,"Cara, que filme HORROROSO FOI ESSE? Só assisti porque simplesmente TODO MUNDO falou bem desse filme e que filme HORRÍVEL! Perdi 2h da minha vida!"
5,2025.12.20,"MARAVILHOSOOOOO. A direção, atuação… tudoooooo. A crítica social perfeita e super bem feita!!!!! Tudo é bem colocado, nada é coincidência… Queria que o mundo todo fosse obrigado a ver essa obra prima."
5,2025.12.15,"Unforgettable. One of my favorite movies that I’ve rewatched multiple times and never gets old. Evokes so many emotions from joy, to sadness, to unnerved and more. most importantly, the movie has a powerful message. 10/10 recommend"
1,2025.12.15,"This movie doesn't have a great plot when you think about it. The filmography is great, the acting is good enough, but if you lifted the plot of this movie out of the trappings of it's high production value, it stands to reason you would be bored out of your mind. It sort of makes me think it was written as a comedy initially and then someone just wanted to change the ending. Let's simplify: Let's say Woo is our main character. Does he learn anything? Does he change in anyway? Is he less likely to be a fraudster in the future? Nope, not really. And all of the nonsense with the former maid. None of it actually changes the story. If you replace the husband of the maid with any random person, the movie would fundamentally not change. There are plenty of people within the story: the driver, the mother, a the pissing homeless person - who could take the place and the movie would be the same. Just another high production movie that demands praise for blowing money."
5,2025.12.09,"Greatest movie of all time fight me on that the message portrays in amazing context and ways, I love the message itself since it’s from the poor and the rich. It’s amazing how they include elements to explain it."
5,2025.12.04,Powerful!!! One family lives off another causing harm. A parasite!
5,2025.12.03,"""Parasite"" is to simply put - the best South Korean movie i have ever seen. And i saw more then few of them and really loved them - i think that this country makes best movies in Asia - in my personal opinion. ""Parasite"" is nothing short of a small masterpiece. It is a stupendously entertaining movie that ""hooked"" me from the first 45 seconds till the last frame for its entire 2 h 9 min running time - i was blown away of how amazingly crafted, acted, written and directed this movie was in every scene. The story was fresh and unique and universal. You can throw a rock at me if Hollywood won't remake this movie with some very well known actors in near future - it is a pure diamond in a movie market. Overall, ""Gisaengchung"" is by far one of the few best movies I've seen this year. It is unusually entertaining and involving story that shows of just how there are big differences in our society, between poor and rich. It's a universal theme. And this movie is a universal treasure."
2.5,2025.11.26,"Overhyped, decent but not anything special."
5,2025.11.26,"One of the best films in recent years. Funny, action packed, surprising and with a point. Plus it looks great."
5,2025.11.23,"I remember watching this first time and not being a fan of it. So after almost 6 years after the release I gave this Movie a watch again since I couldnt remember anything of it. This absolutely blew me away, when I saw the ending I was speechless, it was just sad and absoloutely shocking at the same time and the one iconic scene with the man walking up the stars, while the boy is eating his cake, sends you shivers down your spine. Im glad I watched this Movie once again because this gave me a whole other portrait of this Movie, this is a masterpiece."
4,2025.11.22,Will need a good understanding of both movies and social life. great movie btw.
5,2025.11.20,Best movie of all time.
5,2025.11.20,Definitely his masterpiece. And everyone you talk to loves this movie. I love this movie. Meant to be watched again and again.
5,2025.11.13,"So many genres in one film with such a complicated, sharp critique of the impacts of classism and inequality on one’s humanity."
5,2025.11.12,"Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite represents a paradigmatic breakthrough in contemporary global cinema, an incisive exploration of class, capitalism, and human duplicity rendered with both stylistic audacity and narrative precision. The film’s meticulous mise-en-scène transforms the domestic sphere into a symbolic theater of socio-economic tension, where architectural design, spatial hierarchy, and visual composition become instruments of storytelling as potent as dialogue. Each performance, from the parasitic Kim family to the oblivious Parks, oscillates between caricature and startling verisimilitude, sustaining a tonal dexterity that shifts seamlessly between dark comedy, suspense, and moral horror. Bong’s screenplay interrogates systemic inequality with surgical wit, exposing the grotesque absurdities and inevitable tragedies that emerge from entrenched social stratification. Parasite is not merely a cinematic triumph; it is an intellectual and aesthetic reckoning, a work in which the personal and political, the grotesque and the elegiac, coalesce into a singularly compelling meditation on the human condition—a film that justifiably reshaped the international cinematic landscape."
5,2025.11.10,"From the darkly comic to the deeply tragic, Parasite has everything. Designed as a masterful combination of drama, thriller, and black comedy, it tells the story of two families from completely opposite worlds — one poor, one rich — whose lives intertwine in unpredictable and unsettling ways. If you’re looking for something intense, thought‑provoking, and unforgettable, it’s definitely worth seeing this film. As a movie fan myself, I was really delighted to watch such a fascinating mix of humor and suspense. The first thing that caught my eye was the film’s perfect balance between realism and symbolism. Initially, I thought it was simply satire ridiculing the big gap in social inequality, but actually it turns into a gripping psychological thriller that keeps you guessing. Among all the elements of the film, there are some truly intelligent ideas too, like how the director shows social inequality and moral corruption through space and architecture. My personal favourite? The shocking twist halfway through the film — brilliant and haunting. If you like movies that combine strong storytelling with sharp social commentary and creepy moments, Parasite is an absolute must‑see!"
2.5,2025.11.09,Too dark for yours truly.
4.5,2025.11.06,Everything you heard about this film is true....its amazing!
